"Covid 19, What are the symptoms?","Symptoms include fever, coughing, sore throat, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
However, be aware that at this stage if you have a cough or a cold, it's likely that you just have a cough or a cold and not coronavirus.
If you have serious symptoms such as difficulty breathing, call 000 for urgent medical help.

"Covid 19, When should I get tested?",Your doctor will tell you if you need to get tested.,"If you have been in contact with a person with a COVID-19 infection while they were ill, you need to isolate yourself for 14 days after you last saw that person.
In general, stay home as much as you can.

"Covid 19, Will I get paid if I can't work?","This may depend on whether you're permanent or casual.
Usually, if you are asked by your employer not to work (assuming you're a full-time or part-time employee), you would be entitled to be paid.
However, that typically applies to natural disasters, and not a pandemic like COVID-19.
Experts say that, unless there's a special clause in your Enterprise Agreement, employers may be able to stand employees down without pay.
This will vary with each employer, so it's best to check with them.
For casual workers and independent contractors, including gig economy workers, the situation is potentially more grim.
According to Fair Work, if you're a casual employee needing to look after a family member who is sick with coronavirus, or suffering an unexpected emergency, you are entitled to just two days of unpaid carer's leave per occasion.
After that, you'll need to contact your employer to work out an arrangement.
Casual employees and independent contractors may qualify for the sickness allowance, a means-tested payment that provides up to $560 for singles without children and $1,010 for couples out of work due to illness.
The Government has waived the one-week waiting period to access the allowance.

""In countries where commercial departure options remain available, U.S. citizens who live in the United States should arrange for immediate return to the United States, unless they are prepared to remain abroad for an indefinite period,"" the advisory reads.

The situation is fluid and rapidly evolving, so you should check the State Department's website often and use that information to inform your decisions.

Many countries experiencing outbreaks are implementing travel restrictions, mandatory quarantines and border closures with little advanced notice, and some Americans traveling in those countries have found themselves stranded, without a way to get home. 

If you are in a high-risk group, meaning you are an older person, or have an underlying medical condition, ""you should now be thinking about social distancing,"" Schaffner advised.

""Part of that is thinking really hard about whether you need to get on an airplane,"" he said. ""I think this is a good time to postpone those trips.""

"Covid 19, How is it transmitted?","The first cases of COVID-19 were believed to be linked to a live-animal market in China, but the virus has since been spreading from person to person.

Person-to-person transmission is most likely between people in close contact, about 6 feet. When a person infected with novel coronavirus sneezes or coughs, respiratory droplets could land on people nearby or could possibly be inhaled by those people.

While the virus can be transmitted by touching objects or surfaces contaminated with COVID-19, health experts don't currently believe that's primarily how it's transmitted.","A study of previous coronaviruses found human coronaviruses could theoretically last on surfaces at room temperature for up to nine days.

The type of surface, because viruses survive on shiny, hard surfaces longer than soft ones;
Whether it is exposed to sunlight, because UV radiation kills viruses; and
Temperature and humidity, because viruses last longer at lower temperatures and lower humidity.","[['coronavirus', 'depending on where they live, their travel history or other exposures', 'community', 'social distancing', 'smoking']]","[['human-to-human', 'human-to-human contact', 'through human-to-human contact', 'easily from person-to-person', 'coronavirus']]","[['air droplets', 'by a tourist traveling from Morocco via Italy', 'blood clots travel through the body and can damage the heart, kidneys and other systems.

These efforts are intended to help ""flatten the curve,"" which means distributing the number of coronavirus cases over a longer period of time, to avoid overwhelming the health care system.

Americans should continue to uphold proper flu season hygiene. Wash your hands often, stay home if you're sick and cough or sneeze into your elbow rather than your hand.

If schools in your district have not yet closed, Dr. William Schaffner, medical director for the nonprofit National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, suggested sitting down and outlining a plan for how your family might handle schools and businesses closing. Does an older relative take prescription medication? Now might be a good time to stockpile at least two weeks' worth.

Call schools and ask if there are plans for remote schooling -- as some schools have done. Figure out a childcare plan in the event schools close, and ask about remote working options. Asking more questions now hopefully means asking fewer later.","Not unless you are the one who is sick.

The CDC doesn’t currently recommend any healthy person wear a mask and doctors warn fiddling with putting on and taking off a mask could backfire by exposing your hands to your face.

""Surgical masks fit rather loosely around the face and are not constructed, nor thick enough, to prevent infection,"" Schaffner said.

While they could have a modest benefit, any protection they provide is likely more psychological than scientific. N-95 masks, which hospitals use, are expensive and aren't easy to wear, meaning they're not a practical option for everyday use. As health officials have noted, masks should be reserved for the health care workers, not the general public.

In recent weeks, N-95 masks have grown so scarce that the White House is asking Americans who have them, as well as construction companies, to donate them to hospitals, so that health care workers aren't forced to treat COVID-19 patients without a mask, which puts them at risk for contracting the virus themselves.

If you have traveled to an area with local transmission or have been in close contact with someone who has been exposed to the virus, and develop symptoms, such as cough or fever, your health care provider can work with the local health department to determine whether you should be tested for COVID-19.

If you have symptoms, but no travel history to an outbreak area, you could go to a clinic and have a rapid test done to rule out more common viruses, such as influenza, Merson advised.

If you have mild symptoms and are worried that you might have COVID-19, call your doctor or local health department instead of going to a clinic or doctor's office without an appointment, to ensure you aren't potentially exposing others to the virus. If you have severe breathing problems, seek medical attention or call 911 immediately, recommends Dr. Jennifer Ashton, ABC News’ chief medical correspondent.

You should let the person you speak with know that you have respiratory problems and need to be isolated and seen right away.","Concerned.

"Covid 19, Are pregnant women at higher risk?","We don't know.

Because COVID-19 is a new virus, we don't know whether pregnant women are more susceptible than the general population. Based on data from previous coronaviruses, like SARS and MERS, some experts believe that pregnant women may be at higher risk for severe illness and death, but that data is limited and far from conclusive.

For now, neither the CDC nor the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend any specific guidance for pregnant women beyond what they recommend to the general public.","Yes.

The World Health organization defines a pandemic as ""the worldwide spread of a new disease,"" and on March 11, the WHO's director general announced that COVID-19 met those criteria.

Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO's director general, stressed that the designation doesn't mean that citizens should stop trying to contain the virus.

""Find, isolate, test and treat every case, and trace every contact,"" he said. ""Ready your hospitals. Protect and train your health care workers.""

For the United States, community transmission in several cities and a growing number of cases that aren't able to be traced to travel or contact with individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 makes it probable that there will be extensive spread here.

""A lot of us have been sitting back and watching this from a distant place,"" Schaffner noted, adding that the game has changed in recent days. He cautioned against ""running around like a chicken with its head cut off,"" and recommended thinking ahead. A large increase in cases in your community could mean school closures or other changes to your routine.

""Be prudent and be prepared to participate as much as you can in social distancing when that becomes the order of the day,"" he said. If health authorities advise against mass gatherings, for example, don't make a fuss.

The virus is first thought to have originated from the city's Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market.","It's not completely up to you.

The CDC recently rolled out new guidance, allowing anyone to be tested for COVID-19 without restrictions, as long as their doctor approves. Testing is on the rise in the U.S., but experts say it is not yet enough.

If you have traveled to an area with local transmission or have been in close contact with someone who has been exposed to the virus, and develop symptoms, such as cough or fever, your health care provider can work with the local health department to determine whether you should be tested for COVID-19.

If you have symptoms, but no travel history to an outbreak area, you could go to a clinic and have a rapid test done to rule out more common viruses, such as influenza, Merson advised.

If you have mild symptoms and are worried that you might have COVID-19, call your doctor or local health department instead of going to a clinic or doctor's office without an appointment, to ensure you aren't potentially exposing others to the virus. If you have severe breathing problems, seek medical attention or call 911 immediately, recommends Dr. Jennifer Ashton, ABC News’ chief medical correspondent.

"Covid 19, How is it transmitted?","The first cases of COVID-19 were believed to be linked to a live-animal market in China, but the virus has since been spreading from person to person.

Person-to-person transmission is most likely between people in close contact, about 6 feet. When a person infected with novel coronavirus sneezes or coughs, respiratory droplets could land on people nearby or could possibly be inhaled by those people.

While the virus can be transmitted by touching objects or surfaces contaminated with COVID-19, health experts don't currently believe that's primarily how it's transmitted.","While specific guidelines vary from city to city, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has advised that Americans practice social distancing, and stay home, avoid mass gatherings and maintain 6 feet between themselves and others whenever possible. These efforts are intended to help ""flatten the curve,"" which means distributing the number of coronavirus cases over a longer period of time, to avoid overwhelming the health care system.

Americans should continue to uphold proper flu season hygiene. Wash your hands often, stay home if you're sick and cough or sneeze into your elbow rather than your hand.

"Covid 19, Should I wear a face mask?","Not unless you are the one who is sick.

The CDC doesn’t currently recommend any healthy person wear a mask and doctors warn fiddling with putting on and taking off a mask could backfire by exposing your hands to your face.

""Surgical masks fit rather loosely around the face and are not constructed, nor thick enough, to prevent infection,"" Schaffner said.

While they could have a modest benefit, any protection they provide is likely more psychological than scientific. N-95 masks, which hospitals use, are expensive and aren't easy to wear, meaning they're not a practical option for everyday use. As health officials have noted, masks should be reserved for the health care workers, not the general public.

In recent weeks, N-95 masks have grown so scarce that the White House is asking Americans who have them, as well as construction companies, to donate them to hospitals, so that health care workers aren't forced to treat COVID-19 patients without a mask, which puts them at risk for contracting the virus themselves.

""The other thing a mask can do is give you a false sense of security, and that's not helpful,"" said Dr. Michael Merson, a visiting professor at NYU's School of Global Public Health and a professor at Duke University. Masks work better at preventing people who are coughing and sneezing from spreading respiratory droplets and infecting others, but ""those people who are sick should probably be at home anyway.""

","Novel coronavirus can cause symptoms that range from mild to severe, including cough, fever and shortness of breath.

"Covid 19, Should I be tested for the virus?","It's not completely up to you.

The CDC recently rolled out new guidance, allowing anyone to be tested for COVID-19 without restrictions, as long as their doctor approves. Testing is on the rise in the U.S., but experts say it is not yet enough.

If you have traveled to an area with local transmission or have been in close contact with someone who has been exposed to the virus, and develop symptoms, such as cough or fever, your health care provider can work with the local health department to determine whether you should be tested for COVID-19.

If you have symptoms, but no travel history to an outbreak area, you could go to a clinic and have a rapid test done to rule out more common viruses, such as influenza, Merson advised.

If you have mild symptoms and are worried that you might have COVID-19, call your doctor or local health department instead of going to a clinic or doctor's office without an appointment, to ensure you aren't potentially exposing others to the virus. If you have severe breathing problems, seek medical attention or call 911 immediately, recommends Dr. Jennifer Ashton, ABC News’ chief medical correspondent.

You should let the person you speak with know that you have respiratory problems and need to be isolated and seen right away.","We don't know.

Because COVID-19 is a new virus, we don't know whether pregnant women are more susceptible than the general population. Based on data from previous coronaviruses, like SARS and MERS, some experts believe that pregnant women may be at higher risk for severe illness and death, but that data is limited and far from conclusive.

"Covid 19, Should I cancel my upcoming trip to Europe or Asia?","The decision may be out of your hands.

The U.S. State Department has a Level 4 global health advisory in place, which says that Americans should avoid all international travel because of COVID-19.

""In countries where commercial departure options remain available, U.S. citizens who live in the United States should arrange for immediate return to the United States, unless they are prepared to remain abroad for an indefinite period,"" the advisory reads.

The situation is fluid and rapidly evolving, so you should check the State Department's website often and use that information to inform your decisions.

Many countries experiencing outbreaks are implementing travel restrictions, mandatory quarantines and border closures with little advanced notice, and some Americans traveling in those countries have found themselves stranded, without a way to get home. 

If you are in a high-risk group, meaning you are an older person, or have an underlying medical condition, ""you should now be thinking about social distancing,"" Schaffner advised.

""Part of that is thinking really hard about whether you need to get on an airplane,"" he said. ""I think this is a good time to postpone those trips.""

Even if your trip is to a low-risk area, traveling on a plane will mean being in an enclosed space with fellow travelers. The CDC now recommends that all travelers, especially those with underlying health conditions, avoid cruise ships.","The COVID-19 test can be ordered by a specialist coronavirus clinic, your local GP or a hospital emergency department.

The Federal Government has announced plans to create up to 100 coronavirus pop-up clinics across the country.

Testing methods may include a blood test, a swab test inside your nose or in the back of your throat, or a sputum test, which examines a mix of saliva and mucus.

"Covid 19, Is the outbreak a pandemic?","Yes.

The World Health organization defines a pandemic as ""the worldwide spread of a new disease,"" and on March 11, the WHO's director general announced that COVID-19 met those criteria.

Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO's director general, stressed that the designation doesn't mean that citizens should stop trying to contain the virus.

""Find, isolate, test and treat every case, and trace every contact,"" he said. ""Ready your hospitals. Protect and train your health care workers.""

For the United States, community transmission in several cities and a growing number of cases that aren't able to be traced to travel or contact with individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 makes it probable that there will be extensive spread here.

""A lot of us have been sitting back and watching this from a distant place,"" Schaffner noted, adding that the game has changed in recent days. He cautioned against ""running around like a chicken with its head cut off,"" and recommended thinking ahead. A large increase in cases in your community could mean school closures or other changes to your routine.

""Be prudent and be prepared to participate as much as you can in social distancing when that becomes the order of the day,"" he said. If health authorities advise against mass gatherings, for example, don't make a fuss.

""It shouldn't panic you,"" Schaffner said. ""But it should get your attention.""","Not unless you are the one who is sick.

"Covid 19, What is the current policy on birthing partners?","Expectant mothers should be encouraged to have a birth partner with them during labour and birth, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists says, unless the partner is showing symptoms of coronavirus.

As local trusts may place restrictions on visitors, partners may not be able to go to antenatal appointments, or stay with women on antenatal or postnatal wards. But this doesn't mean they cannot attend the birth, as long as they feel well.

Some NHS trusts will allow only one birth partner to be in attendance, where previously they had allowed two. There were reports that others had banned partners' attendance altogether, before doing a U-turn on official advice.

Understandably, some pregnant women feel nervous about going into a hospital in case it increases their risk of catching the coronavirus.

Maternity units are carrying out some consultations over the phone or via video link, but some in-person visits with the midwife are essential for the wellbeing of the mother and baby, the Royal College of Midwives says.

It adds that home births may no longer be available in some local areas, mainly due to staff and ambulance shortages, but maternity wards are being kept as separate from Covid-19 treatment areas as possible.","The most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness, and a dry cough.

There have been no cases of pets passing the coronavirus to humans, and the same was true during the Sars outbreak in 2003, when there was not a single case of pet-to-human transmission.
Sars is a very closely-related virus to the coronavirus that causes Covid-19.
It is possible that a pet's fur could become contaminated if an infected person has previously touched or stroked the animal.
As always, you should wash your hands with soap and water after handling an animal or its lead, and avoid touching your nose and mouth.
The novel coronavirus is thought to have originated in wildlife and passed to humans via a live animal market, but it is likely the first people infected actually ate infected meat. Since then it has been spread from person to person.

Those with mild asthma should still practise social distancing and only go out for essentials. If you start displaying coronavirus symptoms that do not improve after seven days, or you have difficulty breathing, make sure you call 111 or 999 and explain that you have asthma.
When people with asthma get respiratory infections, it can set off their asthma symptoms. Asthma UK recommends you keep taking your preventer inhaler daily as prescribed, to help cut the risk of an asthma attack being triggered by coronavirus. You should also carry your reliever inhaler with you every day, in case you feel your asthma symptoms flaring up.","It's hard to not be able to see our friends and family in person, especially on special occasions, so sending a gift shows we are thinking of them.
There is no evidence of Covid-19 being transmitted through food, and thorough cooking will kill the virus. The UK Food Standards Agency website has advice on food safety.
If you aren't displaying coronavirus symptoms, make sure you wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before you start baking.
If you are showing symptoms of the virus - or have been in contact with someone who has - then it's probably not a good idea to prepare food for somebody else.
That's because coronavirus spreads through small droplets - packed with the virus - expelled by a sufferer if they cough or sneeze. These can cause an infection if they are breathed in, or if someone touches a surface on which they have landed.
While the chance of contracting coronavirus through food delivery is low, it does exist.
The tin or box the cake is placed in probably presents a higher risk than the cake itself, so your friend should rinse the packaging when she receives the cake.
If you're dropping the cake off yourself, you should maintain social distancing by ensuring you stay 2m (6ft) apart from each other.","[['higher risk', 'People at higher risk of serious COVID-19 illness avoid cruise travel and non-essential air travel', 'People at higher risk', 'COVID-19.

"Covid 19, Are young people who smoke weed or tobacco at more risk? - Eric","Smokers are more likely to have certain serious complications from coronavirus than other people, Public Health England says.
It points to early studies in China that indicate smokers with Covid-19 are 14 times more likely to develop severe respiratory disease.
Smoking tobacco or illegal drugs damages the lungs and airways, causing a range of respiratory problems. The coronavirus attacks the respiratory system, placing smokers at greater risk.
There is also evidence it suppresses and harms the immune system, with smokers twice as likely to catch pneumonia as non-smokers.
Smokers are also likely to regularly touch their mouth, increasing their risk of infection.
Sharing cigarettes or spliffs with others also makes you susceptible to catching coronavirus, which can be transmitted through saliva and via surfaces.","There are currently no formal restrictions on moving house, although the government has strongly advised against it where possible. It says that while there is no need to pull out of transactions, buyers and renters should delay moving so they can observe social distancing and self-isolating guidelines.

For items like a newspaper that can't be washed, the likelihood of transmission is low, but it still makes sense to practise regular hand washing.

Bearing in mind the virus's durability, it's also worth regularly disinfecting plastic and stainless steel surfaces such as door handles.","[['depending on where they live, their travel history or other exposures', 'take care of yourself and follow recommended infection control procedures', 'Older people and people with severe chronic conditions should take special precautions', 'Safe patient transport', 'lack of transmissibility, rather than the control measures that ended SARS, is not based on any evidence.']]","[['More cases of COVID-19 are likely to be identified in the United States in the coming days, including more instances of community spread', 'bats are not part of or that non-bat species are involved in the EBOV maintenance system', 'The United States nationally is in the initiation phase of the pandemic', 'depending on where they live, their travel history or other exposures', 'this ought to be handled with care']]","[['A product that has passed its shelf life might still be safe, but quality is no longer guaranteed', 'Experts recommend testing people for COVID-19', 'product must be refrigerated', 'Shelf life', 'heart, kidneys']]","[['It is safe to do many exercises without a spotter', 'take it home to cook it', ""Drift mining is a way of mining where tunnels are dug horizontally.

"Covid 19, What is the current policy on birthing partners?","Expectant mothers should be encouraged to have a birth partner with them during labour and birth, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists says, unless the partner is showing symptoms of coronavirus.

As local trusts may place restrictions on visitors, partners may not be able to go to antenatal appointments, or stay with women on antenatal or postnatal wards. But this doesn't mean they cannot attend the birth, as long as they feel well.

Some NHS trusts will allow only one birth partner to be in attendance, where previously they had allowed two. There were reports that others had banned partners' attendance altogether, before doing a U-turn on official advice.

Understandably, some pregnant women feel nervous about going into a hospital in case it increases their risk of catching the coronavirus.

Maternity units are carrying out some consultations over the phone or via video link, but some in-person visits with the midwife are essential for the wellbeing of the mother and baby, the Royal College of Midwives says.

It adds that home births may no longer be available in some local areas, mainly due to staff and ambulance shortages, but maternity wards are being kept as separate from Covid-19 treatment areas as possible.","This is highly unlikely to happen, according to scientists and vets.
There have been no cases of pets passing the coronavirus to humans, and the same was true during the Sars outbreak in 2003, when there was not a single case of pet-to-human transmission.
Sars is a very closely-related virus to the coronavirus that causes Covid-19.
It is possible that a pet's fur could become contaminated if an infected person has previously touched or stroked the animal.
As always, you should wash your hands with soap and water after handling an animal or its lead, and avoid touching your nose and mouth.
The novel coronavirus is thought to have originated in wildlife and passed to humans via a live animal market, but it is likely the first people infected actually ate infected meat. Since then it has been spread from person to person.
However, a Malayan tiger at the Bronx Zoo recently tested positive for the virus. She was thought to have been infected by an asymptomatic zookeeper, so there is evidence of human-to-animal transmission.","[['smoking', 'Safe patient transport', 'depending on where they live, their travel history or other exposures', 'More cases of COVID-19 are likely to be identified in the United States in the coming days, including more instances of community spread', 'social distancing']]","[['targeted protocols have not been implemented', 'Yes, it would have worked', 'global collaborative approach', 'bridging the maintenance host with human populations during a spillover event', 'feeding at the same height as bats']]","[['A sterile man cannot father children naturally', 'men could give COVID-19 to partners in sexual intercourse', 'do not die', 'restricted movement and nightly curfew', 'Abenomask']]","[['CDC', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'pandemic', 'COVID-19.', 'COVID-19 during the COVID-19 pandemic']]","[['lockdowns', 'enhanced community quarantine', '2019', 'After he aired the v', 'After he ai']]","[['women should continue to breastfeed', 'increased testing', 'no vaccination, no ride', 'Vaccination Program Act of 2021', 'vaccination']]"
"Covid 19, We're about to exchange on a house but have been advised by the solicitor not to. When will restrictions on house purchases be lifted?","There are currently no formal restrictions on moving house, although the government has strongly advised against it where possible. It says that while there is no need to pull out of transactions, buyers and renters should delay moving so they can observe social distancing and self-isolating guidelines.

If the house you are moving into is empty, it's fine to carry on as long as these rules are observed during the removals process. If the property is occupied, the government is encouraging the buyer and seller to find an alternative moving date further down the line.

Mortgage lenders have also been tightening their restrictions, with some requiring a deposit of at least 25%. But this doesn't affect mortgages which have already been agreed. Many lenders are offering customers who have already exchanged the option to extend their mortgage offer for up to three months so that they can move at a later date.

This timeframe may give you some idea of how long all of this could go on for, although nobody knows for sure.

The house buying process differs between Scotland and England and Wales, but the advice on delaying a move is the same.","We still don't know fully how Covid-19 affects pregnant women, but they have been placed into the ""high risk"" category meaning they should minimise all social contact.

The bill directs $350 billion for loans to small businesses and nonprofits with under 500 employees. The loans would be guaranteed by the Small Business Administration but the actual lender would be approved banks and financial institutions, which should get the money out the door faster. Businesses could receive up to $10 million in loans to float employee salaries, payroll expenses, mortgage and other debt payments. If used for those purposes, the loans would be forgiven in the future. It's a huge deal if it works properly.

 Mass transit could increase your risk of exposure to coronavirus. Luckily, transit systems are upping their cleaning regimens — notably the New York subway system. 
 Dr. Robyn Gershon, a professor of epidemiology at New York University’s School of Public Health, has some tips: When you ride a bus or subway, sneeze or cough into your elbow. Use a tissue to hold onto a pole. Avoid touching your face while you’re riding, and use hand sanitizer if you have it while you’re commuting. 
 Again, wash your hands before, during and after your trip. 
 New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo recommends letting crowded trains or buses pass and waiting for a less crowded one. It’s nearly impossible to maintain 6 feet of distance on a packed subway car.

 Problems with public health infrastructure Two years ago, the CDC stopped funding epidemic prevention activities in 39 countries, including China. This happened because the Trump administration refused to allocate money to a program that started during the 2014 Ebola outbreak. 
 Former CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden warned that move “would significantly increase the chance an epidemic will spread without our knowledge and endanger lives in our country and around the world.”
 Problems with the testing Malfunctions, shortages and delays in availability have all contributed to the slowdown. 
 In the first few weeks of the outbreak in the US, the CDC was the only facility in the country that could confirm test results — even though a World Health Organization test became available around the same time.

 So it’s critical to play it safe and not infect yourself and, in turn, others. The CDC suggests: 
 
 Giving the sick person their own room to stay in, if possible. Keep the door closed.
 Having only one person serve as the caretaker.
 Asking the sick person to wear a face mask, if they are able to. If the mask causes breathing difficulties, then the caretaker should wear a mask instead.","The novel coronavirus is dangerous for several reasons, even if the number of deaths haven’t matched that of the flu.
 The first US case of coronavirus was reported in January, and the first US death from coronavirus was reported in late February. By April 9, the US had more than 456,800 cases of coronavirus, and more than 16,000 people have died.
 Since this flu season started October 1, more than 24,000 Americans have died from the flu, according to CDC estimates. Nationwide, the flu has infected at least 39 million people between October and late March. 
 But here are key differences when comparing the flu vs. coronavirus: 
 
 The CDC estimates for the flu go back to October 2019. But the first US case of coronavirus didn’t emerge until several months later.
 Coronavirus is twice as contagious as the flu. Research indicates a person with the flu infects an average of 1.28 other people, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said. But with coronavirus, “it’s likely between 2 and 3” other people.
 Coronavirus infections have a “very high mortality rate – one in six – among people who are over 80 and people with underlying chronic disease,” epidemiologist Dr. Abdul El-Sayed said. 
 People with coronavirus might not get symptoms for 14 days, and some get no symptoms at all. But during that time, they’re still contagious and can infect others unknowingly. 
 A vaccine is available for the flu, but no vaccine is available for coronavirus. Experts say the number of flu deaths could be drastically reduced if more people got their flu shots. But about half of Americans don’t get vaccinated, including most children who die from the flu.","[['Safe patient transport', 'follow recommended infection control procedures', 'adults at home or in hospital', 'please take care of yourself', 'avoid cruise travel and non-essential air travel']]","[['adults at home or in hospital', 'follow recommended infection control procedures', 'at home or in hospital', 'airborne precautions', 'hospitalization']]","[['Keep away from other people for 14 days', 'Staying home', 'Staying home', 'send his sick sailors off his ship to Guam', 'by letting them breathe in a spray']]","[['Care', 'CDC', 'Care', 'Care', 'Care']]","[['quarantine', 'onal antibody therapy bamlaniv', '2 is about 98% similar to the M pro', 'stay home', 'tocol, publis']]","[['hospitalisation', 'Repurposed antiviral drugs', 'hospitalisation', 'mechanically ventilated', 'hand washing']]"

 “So even when you suppress or stabilize the number of new infections, it’s still going to take a while before you see a decrease in hospitalizations, a decrease in intensive care, and a decrease in deaths.

"Covid 19, Can high or low temperatures kill coronavirus?","“Generally coronaviruses survive for shorter periods of time at higher temperatures and higher humidity than in cooler or dryer environments. However, we don’t have direct data for this virus, nor do we have direct data for a temperature-based cutoff for inactivation at this point,” the CDC says. 
 “The necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface, the environment, etc.”
 President Donald Trump suggested this coronavirus could subside by the warmer summer months, but scientists say it’s too early to tell. And the fact that coronavirus keeps spreading in the Southern Hemisphere during its summer months suggests this strain might not succumb to warmer temperatures. 
 “The short answer is that while we may expect modest declines in the contagiousness of (novel coronavirus) in warmer, wetter weather and perhaps with the closing of schools … it is not reasonable to expect these declines alone to slow transmission enough to make a big dent,” wrote Dr. Marc Lipsitch, director of the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics at Harvard’s T.H.

"Covid 19, Should I wear a face mask in public? If so, how do I make one?","The CDC recently changed its guidance on wearing face masks as more studies about asymptomatic spread pile up.
 Now, the CDC “recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies).”
 But there are several important caveats and key points: 
 
 The public should NOT buy surgical masks or N95 respirator masks. Those are desperately needed by health care workers who are in close contact with coronavirus patients every day. 
 Instead, make your own cloth mask — it’s easy, and you don’t have to sew. US Surgeon General Jerome Adams shows how to make face masks with just a T-shirt and rubber bands in this CDC video. You can also use a bandana and a coffee filter. 
 Don’t be fooled: The main benefit of wearing masks in public isn’t to protect you from getting sick. Rather, it’s to protect others from yourself if you’re sick or you’re an asymptomatic carrier. “This is more for people who might be infected and don’t know it, and to try and lower the likelihood that they will spread this to somebody else,” CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said. The CDC agreed.
 You can definitely still get coronavirus even if you wear a mask. The virus can stay alive on surfaces for up to 3 days, and it’s easy to touch your face whenever you’re not wearing a mask. Also, people often adjust face masks frequently, leading to more touching of the face — a common way that coronavirus spreads.
 It’s important to wash your cloth mask after every use. Here’s how. 
 Wearing cloth masks is just “an additional, voluntary public health measure,” the CDC said. To protect yourself from getting coronavirus, it’s critical to stay 6 feet away from others, wash your hands frequently for at least 20 seconds each time, and stop touching your face.","States have received guidance from the CDC on how to keep voting locations clean.

 We’ve reported many stories about young people getting severely sick with or dying from coronavirus. 
 Dimitri Mitchell, 18, admits he had a “false sense of security.” But he was later hospitalized with coronavirus and now wants everyone to take it seriously. 
 “I just want to make sure everybody knows that no matter what their age is, it can seriously affect them. And it can seriously mess them up, like it messed me up,” Mitchell said. 
 He started feeling sick on St. Patrick’s Day, with just a small cough. “I thought at first it was just a normal cold. And then it started progressively getting worse,” he said. 
 “Four days in, the really bad symptoms started coming along. I started having really bad outbreaks, like sweating, and my eyes were really watery. I was getting warmer and warmer, and I was super fatigued. … I would start experiencing the worst headaches I’ve ever felt in my life. They were absolutely horrible.”
 Eventually, the teen had to be hospitalized. His mother said she worried he might “fall asleep and never wake up.” 
 Mitchell is now recovering, but still has a cough almost a month later. 
 “I just hope everybody’s responsible, because it’s nothing to joke about,” he said. “It’s a real problem, and I want everybody to make sure they’re following social distancing guidelines and the group limits.

 But while children might have mild to no symptoms with coronavirus, they can still get others sick.
 “They can still carry the virus in their bodies,” Gupta said. “They could potentially still shed the virus and be a source of infection.”
 Like everyone else, children should wash their hands frequently for at least 20 seconds, stay at least 6 feet away from anyone coughing or sneezing, and stop touching their faces – which is a lot harder than it sounds.","“We really should be,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force.

 President Donald Trump has declined to give a nationwide stay-at-home order.
 More than 40 states have stay-at-home orders, which generally allow exceptions for grocery shopping, helping a sick loved one or getting outdoor exercise away from other people.
 But states with fewer cases of coronavirus also need to be on high alert, Fauci said.

"Covid 19, Why are medical workers getting sick with or dying from coronavirus if they’re wearing protective gear?","Many health care workers don’t actually have enough protective gear to handle the growing influx of coronavirus patients. 
 Some have resorted to using plastic report covers as masks. The CDC said medical providers might have to use expired masks or reuse them between multiple patients. (This shortage is why the general public should not buy medical masks and instead make cloth masks at home.)
 But it’s not just subpar protective gear that puts medical workers at risk. It’s also the amount of virus they’re exposed to. 
 “The viral load — the amount of virus – does determine the severity of your illness,” emergency room physician Dr. Leana Wen said. “So that could happen in the case of health care workers who are exposed to a lot more Covid-19 as a result of their work — that they get more severely ill.”","There’s currently no cure for the novel coronavirus.

"Covid 19, Why worry about coronavirus when the flu kills many more people?","The novel coronavirus is dangerous for several reasons, even if the number of deaths haven’t matched that of the flu.
 The first US case of coronavirus was reported in January, and the first US death from coronavirus was reported in late February. By April 9, the US had more than 456,800 cases of coronavirus, and more than 16,000 people have died.
 Since this flu season started October 1, more than 24,000 Americans have died from the flu, according to CDC estimates. Nationwide, the flu has infected at least 39 million people between October and late March. 
 But here are key differences when comparing the flu vs. coronavirus: 
 
 The CDC estimates for the flu go back to October 2019. But the first US case of coronavirus didn’t emerge until several months later.
 Coronavirus is twice as contagious as the flu. Research indicates a person with the flu infects an average of 1.28 other people, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said. But with coronavirus, “it’s likely between 2 and 3” other people.
 Coronavirus infections have a “very high mortality rate – one in six – among people who are over 80 and people with underlying chronic disease,” epidemiologist Dr. Abdul El-Sayed said. 
 People with coronavirus might not get symptoms for 14 days, and some get no symptoms at all. But during that time, they’re still contagious and can infect others unknowingly. 
 A vaccine is available for the flu, but no vaccine is available for coronavirus. Experts say the number of flu deaths could be drastically reduced if more people got their flu shots. But about half of Americans don’t get vaccinated, including most children who die from the flu.","Anyone can get coronavirus.
 Any person who comes into close contact with someone who is infected is at risk for contracting the virus, according to the CDC.
 “Black people can get coronavirus, just like other people,” said Dr. Jennifer Caudle, an African-American family physician who has also been debunking coronavirus myths. 
 Caudle said she worries that some people may not take proper precautions to protect themselves against the virus because they may have heard this myth.
 In Africa, the pandemic is gaining a foothold. So far, the virus hasn’t spread in Africa as quickly as it has on some other continents. But numbers there are rising fast.","[['People at higher risk of serious COVID-19 illness avoid cruise travel and non-essential air travel', 'Older people and people with severe chronic conditions should take special precautions', 'please take care of yourself and follow recommended infection control procedures', 'Older people and people of all ages with severe chronic medical conditions', 'little to no pre-existing immunity']]","[['unclear comprehension and negative attitudes', 'poses significant threats to international health', 'there is no vaccine to protect against COVID-19 and no medications approved to treat it', 'risk of exposure versus risk of serious illness and death', 'healthcare workers are at\nhigh risk of infection']]","[['there are no medicines', 'doubts if pets or other livestock can pass on coronavirus to humans', 'because they were worried', 'lung or brain damage', 'heart, kidneys']]","[['Coronavirus disease 2019', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'COVID-19 pandemic in Barbados is part of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic', 'COVID-19 pandemic in the Bahamas is part of the COVID-19 pandemic', 'flu shots']]","[['public officials', 'public officials expressed concern about the spread of COVID-19 via the crowded events', 'celerated by the George Floyd prot', 'sed epide', 'States began to withdraw some troops from']]","[['Infected people are more likely to transmit COVID-19 when they are physically close', 'The risk of breathing these in is highest when people are in close proximity', 'The COVID-19 vaccines', 'when the outbreak was first identified', 'too scared to go to the hospital']]"
"Covid 19, Should I avoid public transportation?","If you rely on public transportation, use caution. If you’re sick or live in an area where an outbreak has been reported, avoid it. 
 Mass transit could increase your risk of exposure to coronavirus. Luckily, transit systems are upping their cleaning regimens — notably the New York subway system. 
 Dr. Robyn Gershon, a professor of epidemiology at New York University’s School of Public Health, has some tips: When you ride a bus or subway, sneeze or cough into your elbow. Use a tissue to hold onto a pole. Avoid touching your face while you’re riding, and use hand sanitizer if you have it while you’re commuting. 
 Again, wash your hands before, during and after your trip. 
 New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo recommends letting crowded trains or buses pass and waiting for a less crowded one. It’s nearly impossible to maintain 6 feet of distance on a packed subway car. 
 If you have a chronic illness, find alternative means of transportation — being in a crowded subway car or bus will significantly increase your risk of infection.","“Younger people, thankfully, seem to be insulated to some extent to protect (them) from getting particularly sick from this,” said CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta. “We don’t know entirely why.”

"Covid 19, How long does coronavirus stay “alive” on surfaces?","Up to three days, depending on the surface. According to a study funded by the US National Institutes of Health:
 
 The novel coronavirus is viable up to 72 hours after being placed on stainless steel and plastic.

"Covid 19, Can coronavirus go through skin and into the body?","“It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads,” the CDC says. 
 More often than not, people get coronavirus through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
 “These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs,” the CDC says.","Many health care workers don’t actually have enough protective gear to handle the growing influx of coronavirus patients. 
 Some have resorted to using plastic report covers as masks. The CDC said medical providers might have to use expired masks or reuse them between multiple patients. (This shortage is why the general public should not buy medical masks and instead make cloth masks at home.)
 But it’s not just subpar protective gear that puts medical workers at risk. It’s also the amount of virus they’re exposed to. 
 “The viral load — the amount of virus – does determine the severity of your illness,” emergency room physician Dr. Leana Wen said. “So that could happen in the case of health care workers who are exposed to a lot more Covid-19 as a result of their work — that they get more severely ill.”","[['COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus', 'Older people and people with severe chronic conditions should take special precautions because they are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness', 'tested', 'First cases of coronavirus disease', 'smoking']]","[['spreading easily from person-to-person', 'transmitted majorly through human-to-human contact', 'respiratory droplets', 'Ultra-early stage', 'The United States nationally is in the initiation phase of the pandemic']]","[['Some toxins can get into the body through more than one route of exposure', 'air droplets', 'It can happen to anyone', 'human skin does not let the alpha particles go through, it cannot penetrate it', 'The virus can also damage organs by itself']]","[['Coronavirus disease 2019', 'pandemic', 'pandemic', 'CDC', 'COVID-19']]","[['it can enter the body and cause infection', 'lets and small airborne particles containing the virus.

"Covid 19, Since a plane's cabin keeps circulating air, will I get sick if another passenger is sick?","Most viruses don’t spread easily on airplanes because of how the air circulates and is filtered, the CDC says. 
 Modern commercial jets recirculate 10-50% of the air in the cabin, mixed with outside air. 
 “The recirculated air passes through a series of filters 20-30 times per hour,” the CDC says. 
 “Furthermore, air generally circulates in defined areas within the aircraft, thus limiting the radius of distribution of pathogens spread by small-particle aerosols. As a result, the cabin air environment is not conducive to the spread of most infectious diseases.”
 Still, try to avoid contact with anyone sneezing or coughing. And if you’re feeling sick, cover your entire mouth and nose with the inside of your elbow when you cough or sneeze.","You can’t, said Dr. James Phillips, chief of disaster and operational medicine at George Washington University Hospital.

 “About 20 or 30 years ago, we decided that we would not over-hospitalize,” Schaffner said.
 Back then, hospitals often had empty hospital beds for new patients. But now, many hospitals are “absolutely full,” Schaffner said. “We have under-built hospital beds because they are very expensive.”
 Also, Americans have grown accustomed to “just-in-time” ordering. But that becomes a huge problem when international supply chains are disrupted by an outbreak. “We didn’t anticipate international turbulence influencing this,” Schaffner said.

 There’s no evidence to suggest coronavirus is transmitted through food, the CDC says. It’s mainly spread through respiratory droplets.
 Even if coronavirus does get into your food, your stomach acid would kill it, said Dr. Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University.
 “When you eat any kind of food, whether it be hot or cold, that food is going to go straight down into your stomach, where there’s a high acidity, low-pH environment that will inactivate the virus,” she said.
 But it’s a good idea to disinfect the takeout containers, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said. Coronavirus is a respiratory virus, and it’s easy to touch your face without realizing it.
 If you don’t have disinfecting wipes, use your own plates or bowls to serve the food.

"Covid 19, Why waste a test kit on a person without symptoms?","Some people with coronavirus have mild or no symptoms. And in some cases, symptoms don’t appear until up to 14 days after infection. 
 During that incubation period, it’s possible to get coronavirus from someone with no symptoms. It’s also possible you may have coronavirus without feeling sick and are accidentally infecting others. 
 So anyone who has had close contact with someone known to have coronavirus should ask a health care provider about getting tested, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.","No. There are some interesting coincidences in the 1981 fiction novel, which says “a severe pneumonia-like illness will spread around the globe” around the year 2020. Modern editions of the book call the biological strain “Wuhan-400,” and the current coronavirus outbreak started in Wuhan, China.
 But there are important differences between the book and reality. The original version of the book called the strain the “Gorki-400,” in reference to a Russian locality, before it was later changed to the “Wuhan-400.” In the book, the virus was man-made, while scientists believe the novel coronavirus started in animals and jumped to humans.

"Covid 19, Why is the US so far behind other countries with testing?","Experts say it’s due to cuts in federal funding for public health and problems with early testing. 
 Problems with public health infrastructure Two years ago, the CDC stopped funding epidemic prevention activities in 39 countries, including China. This happened because the Trump administration refused to allocate money to a program that started during the 2014 Ebola outbreak. 
 Former CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden warned that move “would significantly increase the chance an epidemic will spread without our knowledge and endanger lives in our country and around the world.”
 Problems with the testing Malfunctions, shortages and delays in availability have all contributed to the slowdown. 
 In the first few weeks of the outbreak in the US, the CDC was the only facility in the country that could confirm test results — even though a World Health Organization test became available around the same time. 
 Some test kits that were sent around the country were flawed — a move that put the US behind about “four to five weeks,” says Dr. Rob Davidson, executive director of the Committee to Protect Medicare.","If you can, you should stay home from work when you’re sick, whether or not you have coronavirus.

"Covid 19, Can you contract COVID-19 more than once?","There have been media reports in China, Japan, and South Korea about
individuals who had the virus and eventually tested negative for it and were
released, only to test positive for it again a short time later.

Scientists in those countries have speculated that testing errors could be to
blame, either for a false negative that said the patients were free of the
virus or for the positive result that signalled its reoccurrence.

Dr. Iris Gorfinkel, a family physician and medical researcher, said it’s
really too soon to know whether an individual can contract COVID-19 more than
once, and how quickly that can happen.

“We actually don’t know. We don’t know how long-lasting the immunity is to
it,” she told CTV’s Your Morning on March 16. “These viruses have the tendency
to morph and change.”

In fact, it’s still not even clear if people develop an immediate immunity to
COVID-19, as is typically the case with other virus strains, such as the flu.

“So just like any other virus, there’s the possibility that it could shift or
drift. Just minor changes could change it from a once mild infection to a more
severe infection,” she explained.","As physical distancing recommendations have evolved, it has become clear that
authorities do not want anyone to get close to anyone from outside their
household unless absolutely necessary.

""Stay home"" has become the refrain from political and public health leaders
seeking to flatten the curve of COVID-19 infectiuons.

""Physical distancing is proven to be one of the most effective ways to reduce
the spread of illness during an outbreak,"" PHAC says on its website, which
recommends that all Canadians avoid ""non-essential"" gatherings.

Gorfinkel said people should aim to avoid all unnecessary contact with
individuals to prevent further spread in their communities.

"Covid 19, Can you contract two viruses at the same time, such as new coronavirus and the flu?","While it’s still unclear if someone can contract the new coronavirus more than
once, it is possible to have more than one different virus at the same time.

Dr. Isaac Bogoch said it’s absolutely possible for someone to have COVID-19
and a strain of the flu or another virus simultaneously.

“We sound like broken records in the medical and scientific community, but for
the last two months we’ve been saying ‘We’ve got to prepare for this. We’ve
got to prepare for this. Optimize your health,’” he told CTV’s Your Morning on
March 20.

Bogoch said people should “optimize” their health by getting vaccinated for
everything that they are eligible to be vaccinated for, such as influenza or
bacterial pneumonias.

“It’s totally possible to have what’s called a co-infection and we know people
who have multiple infections at the same time can have a worse outcome,” he
said.

","There is a test that can detect the presence of COVID-19 in a patient, but

"Covid 19, How do you know if you have a cold, the flu, or COVID-19?","Those who are infected with COVID-19 may have few to no symptoms, according to
the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC). If symptoms are present, they can
easily be mistaken for a common cold or the flu because of their similarities.

According to the health agency, the main symptoms of COVID-19 are fever,
coughing, difficulty breathing, and pneumonia in both lungs. In severe cases,
the illness can even result in death.

The World Health Organization lists additional symptoms that have been
documented in some COVID-19 patients, including tiredness, aches and pains,
sore throat, diarrhea, nausea and runny nose.

Gorfinkel said clinicians can’t distinguish between the illnesses based on
symptoms alone. She said they can all present the same way, which is why the
patient’s travel history or history of exposure to the virus is so important
in determining whether someone might have COVID-19.

“We do not have the facilities or the tests to test absolutely everybody, so
that history of travel if you’re basically otherwise well, that’s a critical
part of it,” she explained.","While the SARS-CoV-2 virus can linger on surfaces from anywhere to a couple of

just fair to put them away,” he told CTV’s Your Morning.

precautions with those and people can simply wash them with tap water before
eating them, as they normally should.

"Covid 19, Can young people fall seriously ill?","While much of the attention about who is most vulnerable to COVID-19 has
centred on the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions, [it can
also affect young people.](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/people-
under-40-make-up-one-third-of-canada-s-covid-19-cases-1.4872884)

According to PHAC data, people in their 20s were responsible for 12 per cent
of all confirmed COVID-19 cases in Canada as of March 30, and those aged 19 or
younger made up 4 per cent of the country's total caseload.

Dr. Isaac Bogoch said that everyone can be infected by the novel coronavirus
and there’s always a risk that some people will have a more severe infection.

However, he said older people and those with underlying medical conditions
still have a greater risk of a severe outcome than younger individuals.

“If we take a step back and look at the 30,000-foot view and look at who is
more likely to get a severe infection, it is overwhelmingly those over the age
of 60 and really, over the age of 80 years old,” he told CTV’s Your Morning on
March 20.

Bogoch said the most important metric to look at when studying data about
severe infections from this virus is death.

“If you get infected, you either live or you die, it sounds morbid, but I
think that’s an extremely important distinction to make and if we look at
death, it is overwhelmingly in those over 60 and disproportionately high in
those over the age of 80,” he said.","There is a test that can detect the presence of COVID-19 in a patient, but

COVID-19 cases; however, the World Health Organization says there are no
reports to support this claim.

In an official response, the WHO said it’s not recommending against the use of
the common painkiller.

“We are also consulting with physicians treating COVID-19 patients and are not
aware of reports of any negative effects of ibuprofen, beyond the usual known
side-effects that limit its use in certain populations,” the WHO said in an
update on March 18.

Bogoch agreed with the WHO, saying there is still not enough data on the
subject.

“The short answer is we’re not entirely sure if this is going to do anything
or not. It’s unlikely to have any effect whatsoever,” he told CTV’s Your

impossible because of several factors, including uncertainty over how many
Canadians have actually been infected, unknowns around whether Canadians are

the exact situation so they can give you very specific recommendations based
on your unique setting,” he told CTV’s Your Morning.

In general, though, it appears the answer to that question may be a 'yes.'
PHAC says that anyone who has been in contact with a suspected, probably or
confirmed case of COVID-19 should self-isolate for 14 days, starting at the
time of contact.

This approach was taken by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who entered self-
isolation with his family after Sophie Gregoire Trudeau tested positive for

Canada does not have formal criteria for determining who should be tested,
meaning guidelines vary from province to province. Health-care workers are
generally advised to prioritize testing only those who are showing symptoms of
COVID-19, particularly if they are in hospitals, long-term care homes or other
institutional settings where they could easily spread the virus, as well as
symptomatic travellers entering Canada.

More than 240,000 tests for COVID-19 have been conducted in Canada as of March
31.

Anyone who is showing symptoms of COVID-19 and is concerned they may have
acquired the virus should contact their doctor or other primary health-care
provider.","While it’s still unclear if someone can contract the new coronavirus more than
once, it is possible to have more than one different virus at the same time.

Dr. Isaac Bogoch said it’s absolutely possible for someone to have COVID-19
and a strain of the flu or another virus simultaneously.

“We sound like broken records in the medical and scientific community, but for
the last two months we’ve been saying ‘We’ve got to prepare for this. We’ve
got to prepare for this. Optimize your health,’” he told CTV’s Your Morning on
March 20.

Bogoch said people should “optimize” their health by getting vaccinated for
everything that they are eligible to be vaccinated for, such as influenza or
bacterial pneumonias.

“It’s totally possible to have what’s called a co-infection and we know people
who have multiple infections at the same time can have a worse outcome,” he
said.

the Public Health Agency of Canada has a number of tips on how they can
protect themselves while they provide care.

According to PHAC, only one healthy person should provide care to the
individual with COVID-19, and that person should limit their contact with them
as much as possible. They should also not share personal items with them, such
as toothbrushes, towels, bed linen, utensils or electronic devices. The ill
person should have their own bathroom, if possible. If not, they should put
the toilet lid down every time before flushing.

Caregivers should wear a mask, disposable gloves, and eye protection when
they’re in close proximity to the patient and never reuse the mask or gloves.
They should also frequently wash their hands with soap and water, especially
after contact with the sick individual.

What’s more, caregivers should remain vigilant about monitoring themselves for
symptoms for 14 days.","As physical distancing recommendations have evolved, it has become clear that

developed nations including Italy, France and Spain reporting thousands of

Projecting the spread of the virus through Canada at this point is nearly
impossible because of several factors, including uncertainty over how many
Canadians have actually been infected, unknowns around whether Canadians are
following public health recommendations well enough to curb COVID-19's spread,
and the lag time between when an infection occurs and when it is reflected in
the data.

use of ibuprofen could become an “aggravating factor” for infection in
COVID-19 cases; however, the World Health Organization says there are no
reports to support this claim.

the common painkiller.

aware of reports of any negative effects of ibuprofen, beyond the usual known
side-effects that limit its use in certain populations,” the WHO said in an

or not. It’s unlikely to have any effect whatsoever,” he told CTV’s Your

"Covid 19, What exactly does it mean to flatten the curve?","Flattening the curve refers to the rate at which people are getting infected. Without intervention, the number of individuals who contract Covid-19 rises exponentially, which means it doubles at a constant rate — in this case, every three days. At such a rate, the number of infected individuals will overwhelm our hospital system, because we simply don't have enough hospital beds and respirators to treat them all. The United States doesn't even have enough protective equipment at present to protect its own health care workers. 

Doing the math, if one person is infected with the virus on Jan 1, with the number of people infected people doubling every 3 days, then by March 31, over 1 billion people will have become infected. With the world population being around 7.8 billion, it would only take until April 9 for all of us to be infected.

"Covid 19, Can I get an Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) and a Paycheck Protection Program Loan (PPP)?","Yes, you can get both loans, but the key is to use the money to cover different expenses. Section 1102(a)(2)(G), the section outlining the PPP loans, explains the borrower requirements. It says the borrower has to certify that “the eligible recipient has not received amounts under this subsection for the same purpose and duplicative amounts.”
As a reminder, EIDLs can be used to cover:

Paid sick leave to employees unable to work due to the direct effect of COVID-19. Maintain payroll Increased costs due to supply chain disruption Rent or mortgage payments Repaying obligations that cannot be met due to revenue loss

PPP loan funds can be used to cover:

Payroll costs Group health care benefits during periods of paid, sick, medical, or family leave, and insurance premiums. Interest on a mortgage obligation Rent, under lease agreements in force before February 15, 2020 Utilities, for which service began before February 15, 2020 Interest on any debt incurred before February 15, 2020

So, if you’re getting an EIDL to cover payroll expenses, you can’t get a PPP to cover payroll for the length of the forgiveness period (eight weeks from when the loan is due). You would have to use the EIDL for different operating expenses or payroll for a different period. This will also go for other state or local assistance.
That being said, you don’t have to have both. If you’ve already gotten an EIDL for payroll purposes but just want the PPP loan, you can refinance the loan into a PPP. Any amount that was given to you as a grant under the EIDL will reduce the amount forgiven under PPP.","Flattening the curve refers to the rate at which people are getting infected.

You can find it here. The feedback I’ve received so far is that it takes less than 30 minutes. You’ll need a profit and loss from January 31, 2019 – January 31, 2020. You’ll also need to unfreeze your credit report if you’ve frozen it. The SBA determines initial loan size based on your credit score, not your ability to pay.
You apply for the PPP through your local bank. Yesterday, the SBA offered a specific timeline for different applications.

Starting April 3, 2020, small businesses and sole proprietorships can apply for and receive loans to cover their payroll and other certain expenses through existing SBA lenders. Starting April 10, 2020, independent contractors and self-employed individuals can apply for and receive loans to cover their payroll and other certain expenses through existing SBA lenders. Other regulated lenders will be available to make these loans as soon as they are approved and enrolled in the program.

Just because your date isn’t here yet, it doesn’t mean you can’t start preparing for the process. You can find SBA lenders here.

"Covid 19, What exactly does it mean to flatten the curve?","Flattening the curve refers to the rate at which people are getting infected. Without intervention, the number of individuals who contract Covid-19 rises exponentially, which means it doubles at a constant rate — in this case, every three days. At such a rate, the number of infected individuals will overwhelm our hospital system, because we simply don't have enough hospital beds and respirators to treat them all. The United States doesn't even have enough protective equipment at present to protect its own health care workers. 

Doing the math, if one person is infected with the virus on Jan 1, with the number of people infected people doubling every 3 days, then by March 31, over 1 billion people will have become infected. With the world population being around 7.8 billion, it would only take until April 9 for all of us to be infected.

The situation in Italy has shown us that, without enough equipment, hospitals will be compelled to turn away some of the most infirmed among us, resulting in increased fatalities.  

Staying home does not prevent you from contracting the virus down the line, but from contracting the virus and overwhelming the medical establishment now. Postponing exposure buys time for the scientific and medical community to develop effective treatments or a vaccine to minimize or protect against infection.","As Covid-19 is spread through droplets, it can reach us through the air.

"Covid 19, What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?","Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news. 


 
You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:


 
Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands. 



Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease. 



Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick. 



Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19. 



Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. 


 
Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections. 


 
Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease. Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.",Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.,"[['take care of yourself and follow recommended infection control procedures', 'wearing masks', 'take care of yourself', 'Safe patient transport', 'interim guidelines']]","[['recommended infection control procedures', 'evidence-based measures', 'no vaccine', 'hand hygiene', 'avoid visits to the area']]","[['simple cloth facemasks', 'Staying home', 'Wearing a mask and washing your hands', 'Staying home when sick', 'stay home']]","[['wearing surgical masks', 'To call myself beloved, to feel myself', 'SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes COVID-19\n 2019-nCoV is the old name for SARS-CoV-2\n Coronavirus disease 2019 is the complete name for COVID-19\n community spread', 'COVID-19 pandemic in the Bahamas', 'COVID-19 pandemic spread to Vietnam on 23 January 2020, when its first known case of COVID-19 was reported.']]","[['would not simply va', 'avoiding people of Chinese origin', 'If you are vaccinated', 'masks', 'build a forty-kilometer (25 mi) fence on the border with Zimbabwe']]","[['face masks', 'face masks', 'masks', 'face masks', 'hitting] the body with a tremendous [light']]"
"Covid 19, Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading","Follow the guidance outlined above (Protection measures for everyone)
Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. If it is essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or to go out, e.g. to buy food, then wear a mask to avoid infecting other people.
Why? Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible COVID-19 and other viruses. 


If you develop fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical advice promptly as this may be due to a respiratory infection or other serious condition. Call in advance and tell your provider of any recent travel or contact with travelers.
Why? Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also help to prevent possible spread of COVID-19 and other viruses.","The infection period for the virus will vary from person to person.

For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.

COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly.

"Covid 19, How Does COVID-19 Spread?","People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.

WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings.","The infection period for the virus will vary from person to person.

These estimates will be updated as more data become available.","The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.

"Covid 19, What Are The Symptoms Of COVID-19?","The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.

While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this route is not a main feature of the outbreak. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings. Because this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly, after using the bathroom and before eating.","Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19.

"Covid 19, And let's start with the trends here. Who's getting sick, and how sick are they getting?","Sure. Well, we do have a preliminary snapshot of cases in the U.S. from the CDC. And the picture so far is similar to what was documented in China. Coronavirus hits oldest people - older people the hardest. The CDC analysis found that about half of the people who've ended up in intensive care are 65 and older; the highest percentage of deaths in the U.S. has been among those 85 and older. Now this is based on an analysis of about 500 patients admitted to the hospital in the U.S. - so not all of the cases. But here's something to be aware of - younger adults can be vulnerable too; about 20% of people hospitalized were in their 40s and 50s. And this may come as a surprise - about 20% were younger. So some millennials and Gen Xers have gotten seriously ill.","With new research that suggests the new coronavirus can live on surfaces for hours or days, the prospect of going grocery shopping can seem daunting.
But you can manage the risk.
First of all, the viability of the virus goes down over time and it's sensitive to temperature – so it dies off more quickly in room temperature than it does in the cold.
Second, when you go to a grocery store, people aren't generally touching all the cans on the shelf — although there tends to be more handling of individual items in the produce section.
Among the things you can do to protect yourself and others are:
Ko says it helps to understand the differing levels of risk in different situations. Coming into close contact with a person who is infected with coronavirus carries greater risk than touching a shopping cart that might have been touched by an infected person hours or days earlier.
When it comes to disinfecting things, it makes sense to focus on high-touch surfaces. Ko says you should worry more about disinfecting bathroom doorknobs and faucets at home than about a can of tomato soup from the supermarket.

"Covid 19, Are those people who had some other underlying health problem?","Well, that's important to understand, and we don't have a complete picture yet of which underlying medical problems were present in how many of these younger people. But it's worth noting - an analysis from Italy shows that about 99% of the people who've died in Italy from the virus had at least one underlying illness or condition such as heart disease, a history of stroke, diabetes. So these certainly seem to increase the risk of death or serious illness.","Masks can also function as an important visual cue, says Joseph Allen, an assistant professor of exposure and assessment science at Harvard University T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
They're a ""reminder that we need to be taking these precautions and serve as a reminder to people to keep that 6-foot buffer,"" he says. ""It should be seen as a badge of honor. If I'm wearing a mask out in public, it means I'm concerned about you, I'm concerned about my neighbors, I'm concerned about strangers on the chance that I'm infectious. I want to do my part in limiting how I might impact you.""
Klompas agrees — and says that it can also give the wearer a welcome sense of security.
""It feels like you're behind a shield,"" he says, ""and I think that in itself can be reassuring.""
And for the others around you, it's a warning. ""It says: Watch out. There's a public health crisis right now, there's a virus going around, we need to be on top guard,"" says Klompas. ""I think it can actually be a reinforcer, a reminder of the state of crisis that we face in society.""

"Covid 19, Well, let's talk about treatments for people who would end up in the hospital with COVID-19.

What's actually available?","That's right. Well, the Milken Institute is tracking the development of a whole bunch of potential treatments and vaccines. They've identified literally dozens of different candidates in the works on both the vaccine side, the treatment side - over 40 different compounds being looked at for the vaccine. But a vaccine is definitely a ways off. I mean, 12 to 18 months is an optimistic estimate out there.

In regard to treatments, there are clinical trials underway to look at the safety, efficacy of different drugs, from antivirals to antibody treatments. With one candidate, an antiviral called Remdesivir, some early results are expected later this spring, and there's a lot of hope out there. But obviously it's important to see what the studies find.","There is little data so far on cloth or homemade masks in general — let alone data that dictates how many pleats to put on your home-sewn version.
Griffin says the best material to use is a tight-weave cotton. ""Don't use a synthetic or a polyester because they've looked at the virus's ability to survive on surfaces, and spandex is the worst,"" he says.
Johns Hopkins Medicine has one design you might try. Kaiser Permanente has another design, as well as a video showing how to make a mask using a sewing machine. Both recommend 100% woven cotton fabric. Kaiser recommends washing and drying the fabric two or three times before cutting it, so it doesn't shrink later.
You can make a mask out of a T-shirt, no sewing machine required. You could also try making one out of (unused) shop towels.

"Covid 19, So how can I tell the difference between someone who just has allergies and somebody who has something worse?","So there is some overlap. But there are key differences, too. I've spoken to a bunch of allergists about this. And here is one very important distinction - fever is a symptom of COVID-19, but it is not a symptom of seasonal allergies. With all of that pollen starting to develop around the country, a lot of people are sneezing and will have a runny nose. These are typical symptoms of seasonal allergies but not necessarily typical of coronavirus. Cough is another very important distinction. Coughing is usually not a main symptom of seasonal allergies, but it is a key symptom of COVID-19, especially a dry cough.","Well, that's important to understand, and we don't have a complete picture yet of which underlying medical problems were present in how many of these younger people. But it's worth noting - an analysis from Italy shows that about 99% of the people who've died in Italy from the virus had at least one underlying illness or condition such as heart disease, a history of stroke, diabetes. So these certainly seem to increase the risk of death or serious illness.","[['depending on where they live, their travel history or other exposures', 'symptoms', 'Safe patient transport', 'Figure 3', 'smoking']]","[['depending on where they live, their travel history or other exposures', 'a global presence and not only a new pathogen', 'risk of exposure versus risk of serious illness and death', 'More cases of COVID-19 are likely to be identified in the United States in the coming days, including more instances of community spread', 'we can say, it would have been sufficient']]","[['bad', 'untrustworthy', 'keep the words very simple', 'If someone has it, they can tell the person who wants it', 'Pragmatics']]","[['A view', 'If someone has it, they can tell the person who wants it', 'cryptography', 'difference is something that two or more things do not have in common', 'CDC']]",[[]],[[]]
"Covid 19, People are also asking about re-infection, whether you are immune to this once you've had it.","Well, with a lot of viruses, I mean, after you've gotten exposed to it the first time, you'll have partial protection against it going forward. And there is reason to think that the same could be true with this virus. Now, the CDC says there's still a lot that is not known about the immune response to COVID-19. But for now, they're saying patients who have recovered from an infection are not likely to be re-infected shortly afterwards.","It probably can — but you shouldn't be overly worried. Here's why.
So far, there aren't scientific findings on how long the virus can live on fabric. But fabrics are generally porous — as is cardboard, which has been tested. And a recent study did find that the virus can live on cardboard for up to 24 hours.
""The thing that you have to consider, though, is that those tests are done in ideal testing circumstances,"" says Rachel Graham, a virologist at the University of North Carolina. ""That's like in some kind of hermetically sealed box where there's no fluctuation in humidity, there's no wind, there's nothing that can contribute toward desiccating the virus. And so desiccation — or drying out the virus — would actually reduce the amount of time it's actually viable on any kind of surface.""
Plus, porousness is a good thing when it comes to avoiding viral transmission. A surface that is permeable, like a fabric, tends to trap viruses more easily than hard surfaces.
""It's less at risk of transmitting because the virus gets kind of stuck to the [porous] surface, and so it can't be easily transferred back off of it,"" Graham says. ""Porous surfaces also suck the fluid out of it. The viral membrane is a lipid membrane, and so if that becomes dried out, it's basically done, infectivity-wise.""
If you are concerned that clothing or other fabric items might have picked up the virus, throw the clothing in the washer and dryer. For most situations, says Graham, your detergent will do its job and get rid of any infective particles — or at least sanitize them to the point where they're not a risk to you.
If you're taking care of someone who is ill or immunocompromised or if you're working in a health care setting, you may want to take additional precautions. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommendations for households with suspected or confirmed cases of the coronavirus, which include wearing gloves when handling dirty laundry from an ill person and using the warmest appropriate water setting when washing clothes or linens to disinfect them.
I like to use wipes to disinfect surfaces in my home — especially surfaces that are frequently touched. But how much surface area can one wipe be used on before it loses its ability to kill the coronavirus?
The first step is to check the label on the wipes you're using. For instance, the label on a container of Clorox wipes instructs: ""Use enough wipes for treated surface to remain visibly wet for 4 minutes. To kill viruses, let stand 15 seconds.""
That time and that visible wetness are important, says Erica Hartmann, an expert in environmental microbiology at Northwestern University's McCormick School of Engineering.
Regardless of the particular ingredients in the wipes you're using, ""they're all chemicals that have to react,"" she says. ""And those chemical reactions aren't instantaneous — they take a certain amount of time. So what you're doing when you're keeping the surface wet is you're basically allowing time, allowing the chemical reactions to take place.""
So if that Clorox wipe isn't making the surface visibly wet for 4 minutes, you're trying to cover too much ground with one wipe.
There's no exact figure for how much surface area a wipe can handle. But a 2018 study found that one wipe is generally more effective over 1 to 2 square feet than 8 square feet.
And you don't need a premade wipe to clean surfaces: You can also use a liquid product on a cloth or paper towel. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises using products that contain bleach (sodium hypochlorite) or alcohol (at least 70%) and following the manufacturer's directions. You can make your own cleaning solution by mixing 4 teaspoons of bleach per quart of water, according to the CDC.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has posted a list of approved products to disinfect against the coronavirus.
Strangers keep petting my dog when we go for a walk. Could my dog transmit the virus on its fur?
Saskia Popescu, an infection prevention epidemiologist at the health care system HonorHealth, says she's not especially concerned about dog fur transmitting the virus. ""I think that I would probably be more worried if somebody was coughing all over the place and went to touch my dog's harness or something — something inanimate,"" she says. ""I would put it in the lower-risk category.""
That's because like fabric, fur is a porous surface — so it isn't easy for a person to pick up bits of virus from it. ""The chances of you getting it from fur and hair is going to be less than getting it from a solid surface,"" says Graham, the virologist. Still, she said, she would err on the side of caution and ask people not to pet your dog right now.
Graham says one way to make sure your dog doesn't get touched by overenthusiastic petters is to avoid letting your dog off leash in a place where it may encounter other people. Rather than going to a dog park, she says, ""it might be a better idea to take your dog out in the yard or somewhere you know that there's not going to be a lot of people.""
And despite the occasional media report of a dog diagnosed with COVID-19, there is no evidence that pets can contract or spread COVID-19. The CDC says it has not received any reports of pets or animals becoming sick with the disease. The American Veterinary Medical Association concurs: ""Infectious disease experts and multiple international and domestic human and animal health organizations agree there is no evidence at this point to indicate that pets become ill with COVID-19 or that they spread it to other animals, including people.""
One note: If you are already sick with COVID-19, the association recommends limiting contact with animals ""out of an abundance of caution"" until more is known about the virus. If you're not sick with the coronavirus, the group says you can interact with your pet as you normally would — while practicing good hygiene, including washing your hands before and after interacting with your pet.","[['COVID-19', 'COVID-19 first started, shows that some people are at higher risk of getting very sick from this illness', 'COVID-19 is not fully known', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19']]","[['many people should have been immune or at least partial-\nly immunoprotected', '191871919', 'More cases of COVID-19 are likely to be identified in the United States in the coming days, including more instances of community spread', 'little to no pre-existing immunity', 'The United States nationally is in the initiation phase of the pandemic']]","[['Herd immunity', 'Immunization', 'As a person grows older, their immune system change.

"Covid 19, So when might things begin to get back to normal?","Oh, gosh. Well, you know, we're halfway through that 15-day period announced last week asking everyone to hunker down, stay home. And what Anthony Fauci, the top adviser, has said over the weekend is that the social distancing, all the measures we're taking - they will have an effect. But we just can't quantify the effect yet. I mean, how much we may be slowing the spread here is masked by the significant increase in cases each day, as you just mentioned at the top.

So you know, as testing expands, we're going to get this increase in cases. Hard to see the progress here - it's likely going to be much, much longer before life feels like normal again, right? I mean, many schools have extended closures. There'll be lots of distance learning going on. Many scientists and public health experts watching China as the country lifts its restrictions. Does the virus stay under control, or does it start to spread again? We can learn a lot by watching what happens there.","Last week, the U.K. government signaled that it might be considering a different approach to coronavirus control than the rest of the world — in essence, allowing a large percentage of the population to become infected in order to develop a ""herd immunity"" that would eventually end the epidemic.
Herd immunity occurs when enough people in a population are immune to disease — either because they've been infected and recovered or they've been vaccinated against it. The idea is that the pool of people who can catch the disease has been reduced, reducing the risk to the so-far unaffected.
Sir Patrick Vallance, the U.K. government's chief scientific adviser, said that about 60% of the population would need to get the coronavirus in order to get a herd immunity effect.
But using such an approach would raise a big question: During that spread, how do you protect the most vulnerable groups – the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions?
Herd immunity works with contagious diseases like measles, for which a vaccine exists. But the idea that the U.K. would not immediately work to suppress the number of cases, especially as there are no approved treatments for COVID-19 yet and the disease has killed thousands in Italy, stirred an immediate public backlash.
The government quickly backtracked, and on Friday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said all restaurants, pubs and gyms would close for the foreseeable future to reduce transmission.
And there is no certainty that herd immunity would even work for coronavirus. That approach ""assumes that people being infected are immune and cannot get re-infected. And we don't know that as of yet,"" says Albert Ko, professor of epidemiology and medicine at the Yale School of Public Health.
People who go outside to exercise are sometimes shamed on TV and on social media for risky behavior. Is it okay to go outside for a walk, run or bike ride?
The White House coronavirus guidelines for the 15-day period that started Monday advise avoiding ""discretionary travel, shopping trips and social visits,"" as well as ""social gatherings in groups of more than 10 people."" But outdoor exercise is not on the list.
So unless local guidelines instruct otherwise, fresh air and outdoor exercise are allowed – though it's important to keep some distance between yourself and others. The coronavirus is thought to spread primarily through close contact between people – within about six feet.
The primary mode of transmission is through respiratory droplets.
There is better airflow outside than in confined spaces. That air flow outside reduces the risk of one person transmitting the virus to another through droplets in the air, says Albert Ko, the Yale epidemiologist. ""So if you're going out and you're hiking or biking or running and you're not within, say, six feet or 10 feet of another person, I would consider that a healthy, safe practice.""
Ko also points to the significant mental health issues that can be caused or exacerbated when people are cooped up.

It's not yet clear whether people can be reinfected by this coronavirus or how long immunity might last after infection.
Immunity after recovery from COVID-19 would be a boon in the global fight to rein in the virus. People who have recovered and gained immunity would be especially valuable as health care workers. The spread of the virus would slow if more people had immunity to it. And antibodies from recovered people could help in developing a treatment for the disease.
As NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce has reported, scientists are looking for clues about immunity to and reinfection from other coronaviruses.
The severe coronaviruses SARS and MERS did produce antibodies in those who had the virus. In the case of MERS, survivors generated an immune response to the virus that could be detected up to two years later. And the sicker the patient was, the more long lasting their immune response.
But in the case of the four seasonal coronaviruses that are a cause of the common cold, they can sicken people over and over again. After infection with one of these viruses, antibodies are produced — but then the levels slowly decline and people become susceptible again.
There are some indications that the new coronavirus, officially known as SARS-CoV-2, can spur immunity. New not-yet-peer-reviewed research in rhesus macaques found that the new coronavirus does not cause reinfections.
""I think there's a very likely scenario where the virus comes through this year, and everyone gets some level of immunity to it, and if it comes back again, we will be protected from it,"" Matt Frieman, a coronavirus researcher at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore, told NPR.

"Covid 19, I've heard that taking drugs like ibuprofen to ease COVID-19 symptoms could actually worsen the progress of the illness. Is that true?","The World Health Organization and many infectious disease experts say that there is no good scientific evidence establishing a link between ibuprofen and worsening of COVID‑19.
The notion that such a link exists was sparked last weekend when a tweet by the French health minister warned people not to take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs — a category of pain relievers and fever reducers that includes ibuprofen — because, he said, some French COVID-19 patients had experienced serious side effects. The warning was also included in a bulletin from the French health ministry, which counseled that patients should instead use acetaminophen, the generic name for Tylenol.
But experts say that warning isn't based on data.
""Based on currently available information, WHO does not recommend against the use of ibuprofen,"" the WHO stated on its official Twitter account, adding, ""'We are also consulting with physicians treating COVID-19 patients and are not aware of reports of any negative effects of ibuprofen, beyond the usual known side effects that limit its use in certain populations.""
Dr. Angela Rogers, a pulmonologist at the Stanford University Medical Center and chair of its intensive care unit's COVID-19 task force, notes that Tylenol is the go-to medication for patients who are sick enough to be hospitalized for any infection. That's because these patients are at higher risk of damage to internal organs, including kidneys. And kidney damage can be a side effect of ibuprofen for some patients who use it long-term in higher doses, says Rogers, whose research focuses on the kind of acute respiratory distress experienced by the most severe COVID-19 cases.
Tylenol, like any medicine, isn't risk-free either; Rogers notes that acetaminophen can cause serious liver damage in high doses. In low doses, though, she says, Tylenol is ""very effective"" for reducing fever and ""very safe.""","That's right.

"Covid 19, How do I manage any risks while grocery shopping?","With new research that suggests the new coronavirus can live on surfaces for hours or days, the prospect of going grocery shopping can seem daunting.
But you can manage the risk.
First of all, the viability of the virus goes down over time and it's sensitive to temperature – so it dies off more quickly in room temperature than it does in the cold.
Second, when you go to a grocery store, people aren't generally touching all the cans on the shelf — although there tends to be more handling of individual items in the produce section.
Among the things you can do to protect yourself and others are:
Ko says it helps to understand the differing levels of risk in different situations. Coming into close contact with a person who is infected with coronavirus carries greater risk than touching a shopping cart that might have been touched by an infected person hours or days earlier.
When it comes to disinfecting things, it makes sense to focus on high-touch surfaces. Ko says you should worry more about disinfecting bathroom doorknobs and faucets at home than about a can of tomato soup from the supermarket.
""There's never anything that has zero risk,"" Ko says, ""but the risk is so much lower than [surfaces] that are more frequently touched.""","Yes. But only if you use the mask properly and don't touch it with your hands afterward.

"Covid 19, Can face coverings prevent the spread of the virus?","The primary benefit of covering your nose and mouth is that you protect others. While there is still much to be learned about the novel coronavirus, it appears that many people who are infected are shedding the virus – through coughs, sneezes and other respiratory droplets – for 48 hours before they start feeling sick. And others who have the virus – up to 25%, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Robert Redfield — may never feel symptoms but may still play a role in transmitting it.
That's why wearing a mask even if you don't feel sick can be a good idea.
If you cough or sneeze, the mask can catch those respiratory droplets so they don't land on other people or surfaces. ""So it's not going to protect you, but it is going to protect your neighbor,"" says Dr. Daniel Griffin at Columbia University, an expert on infectious diseases. ""If your neighbor is wearing a mask and the same thing happens, they're going to protect you. So masks worn properly have the potential to benefit people.""
The best masks are N95 respirators, but the general public is urged not to use them because they are fiercely needed by health care workers right now. If you have those, consider donating them immediately to a local hospital or find a drop-off here. Same goes for surgical masks — those thin blue models-- which offer less protection but are helpful and are also in short supply.","As NPR has previously reported, some research has shown that cotton T-shirt material and tea towels might help block respiratory droplets emitting from sick people — though it's not clear how much protection they provide.
Another study, of health care workers in Vietnam, found that use of cloth masks resulted in greater infection than either those wearing surgical masks or a control group, some of whom also wore surgical masks.
We don't yet know exactly how effective homemade masks are, but Griffin thinks they're a good idea — he has even taken to wearing one over his N95 respirator.","[['social distancing', 'Haphazard transport of infected cases', 'interim guidelines', 'More cases of COVID-19 are likely to be identified in the United States in the coming days, including more instances of community spread', 'limitations on your movement and activity']]","[['The identification of the high-risk cases can then be quarantined earlier', 'ion), and Cornus officinalis 15 g above yielded decoction, and both taken', 'personal protective equipment', 'female students in Korean washed hands more frequently', 'little to no pre-existing immunity']]","[['Wearing a mask and washing your hands', 'Washing', 'Wearing a mask and washing your hands can prevent the virus from spreading', 'people normally wear face masks in Hong Kong', 'People can avoid spreading the virus by regularly washing their hands, covering their mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people, staying away from crowds, wearing medical or cloth face coverings']]","[['surgical masks', 'Cloth face masks are commonly used during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially when surgical and other medical face coverings are not available', 'Injections', 'the government closed its border with South Africa', 'Vietnam']]","[['ad trave', 'wearing masks', 'self-isolation and quarantine', 'face masks', 'wear a face mask']]","[['individuals with COVID-19 or COVID-19 symptoms, as well as individuals who consider themselves to be high-risk, should continue to wear facial coverings', 'personal protective equipment', 'handshakes', 'The use of face masks or coverings has been recommended in public settings to minimise the risk of transmission', 'Face masks']]"

"Covid 19, How often do I need to wash it?","Griffin says to think of a mask as like underwear: It needs to be washed after each use.
""You don't take this dirty mask off, put it in your purse and then stick it back on your face,"" he says. ""It's something that once you put on, is potentially either touching your coughs, sneezes or the spray of your speech, or protecting you from the coughs, spray, speech of other people. And now it's dirty. It needs to basically be either discarded or washed.""
So if you're wearing a cloth mask, put it into the laundry basket immediately. If it's disposable, throw it away.
It's a big no-no to pull the mask down to eat a snack, then pull it back up: You've just gotten whatever dirty stuff is on the mask on your hands and into your mouth.","Last week, the U.K. government signaled that it might be considering a different approach to coronavirus control than the rest of the world — in essence, allowing a large percentage of the population to become infected in order to develop a ""herd immunity"" that would eventually end the epidemic.
Herd immunity occurs when enough people in a population are immune to disease — either because they've been infected and recovered or they've been vaccinated against it. The idea is that the pool of people who can catch the disease has been reduced, reducing the risk to the so-far unaffected.
Sir Patrick Vallance, the U.K. government's chief scientific adviser, said that about 60% of the population would need to get the coronavirus in order to get a herd immunity effect.
But using such an approach would raise a big question: During that spread, how do you protect the most vulnerable groups – the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions?
Herd immunity works with contagious diseases like measles, for which a vaccine exists. But the idea that the U.K. would not immediately work to suppress the number of cases, especially as there are no approved treatments for COVID-19 yet and the disease has killed thousands in Italy, stirred an immediate public backlash.
The government quickly backtracked, and on Friday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said all restaurants, pubs and gyms would close for the foreseeable future to reduce transmission.
And there is no certainty that herd immunity would even work for coronavirus. That approach ""assumes that people being infected are immune and cannot get re-infected. And we don't know that as of yet,"" says Albert Ko, professor of epidemiology and medicine at the Yale School of Public Health.
People who go outside to exercise are sometimes shamed on TV and on social media for risky behavior. Is it okay to go outside for a walk, run or bike ride?
The White House coronavirus guidelines for the 15-day period that started Monday advise avoiding ""discretionary travel, shopping trips and social visits,"" as well as ""social gatherings in groups of more than 10 people."" But outdoor exercise is not on the list.
So unless local guidelines instruct otherwise, fresh air and outdoor exercise are allowed – though it's important to keep some distance between yourself and others. The coronavirus is thought to spread primarily through close contact between people – within about six feet.
The primary mode of transmission is through respiratory droplets.
There is better airflow outside than in confined spaces. That air flow outside reduces the risk of one person transmitting the virus to another through droplets in the air, says Albert Ko, the Yale epidemiologist. ""So if you're going out and you're hiking or biking or running and you're not within, say, six feet or 10 feet of another person, I would consider that a healthy, safe practice.""
Ko also points to the significant mental health issues that can be caused or exacerbated when people are cooped up.
""My personal feeling is that if people are practicing sound respiratory hygiene, sound hand hygiene, they're distancing themselves physically from others outside, and you're exercising and walking in the park — I think that's actually a good public health practice.""","[['ten days', 'depending on where they live, their travel history or other exposures', 'infection control', '14 days', 'up to 14 days']]","[['every day', '20', 'de', 'The United States nationally is in the initiation phase of the pandemic', '.html (2020).']]","[['hands', '20\xa0seconds', 'police racism', 'social jetlag', 'kidneys']]","[['CDC', 'COVID-19', 'Wash (creek), a usually dry creek bed or gulch that temporarily fills with water after a heavy rain', 'COVID-19.', 'COVID-19 during the COVID-19 pandemic in India.']]","[['by the state', 'n the reliability of', 'ed on other s', 'at least twenty seconds', 'at least twenty seconds']]","[['at least twenty seconds', 'regularly wash hands with soap and water', 'hand', 'at least twenty seconds', 'pouring mustard oil through the nose']]"
"Covid 19, Is there one best mask design?","There is little data so far on cloth or homemade masks in general — let alone data that dictates how many pleats to put on your home-sewn version.
Griffin says the best material to use is a tight-weave cotton. ""Don't use a synthetic or a polyester because they've looked at the virus's ability to survive on surfaces, and spandex is the worst,"" he says.
Johns Hopkins Medicine has one design you might try. Kaiser Permanente has another design, as well as a video showing how to make a mask using a sewing machine. Both recommend 100% woven cotton fabric. Kaiser recommends washing and drying the fabric two or three times before cutting it, so it doesn't shrink later.
You can make a mask out of a T-shirt, no sewing machine required. You could also try making one out of (unused) shop towels. But no matter what you make it out of, try to make it fit closely to your face and don't touch the front of it once you've started wearing it.","Oh, gosh.

I mean, how much we may be slowing the spread here is masked by the significant increase in cases each day, as you just mentioned at the top.

So you know, as testing expands, we're going to get this increase in cases. Hard to see the progress here - it's likely going to be much, much longer before life feels like normal again, right? I mean, many schools have extended closures. There'll be lots of distance learning going on. Many scientists and public health experts watching China as the country lifts its restrictions.

That means sticking to a regular bedtime and wake time. Try to go 90 minutes without any screen time before bed -- that means no emails, social media or watching T.V. You can also take baby steps, beginning with 15 minutes, then working your way up.  Working out, whether that means taking a socially distant walk or doing an at- home routine, can also help tire you out and dispel extra nervous energy. Taking a warm shower or bath 90 minutes before lights out may also help prime you for a better night’s sleep. Be sure to nix the coffee, alcohol and any eating before bed -- these things don’t promote quality rest. Finally, [manage your anxiety](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/style/self-care/sleep-tips- benefits-coronavirus.html) through meditation, deep breathing techniques and, in some cases, medication.

Those services have a large network in place, though, which means their businesses are likely to thrive. Smaller retailers will not as Americans eschew restaurants, bars and specialty stores. That is why some restaurants are promoting delivery services as a way to stay in business, and why some cities that have ordered restaurants and bars to close have made exceptions for places providing delivery and takeout.  But what about delivery workers? Some groups, like Gig Workers Rising, are demanding that employers like Doordash and Instacart do more to protect them on the job. Recently, the group started [a petition](https://www.coworker.org/petitions/demand-gig-economy-companies- give-paid-sick-time-off-during-coronavirus) asking companies to provide paid time off to drivers who become sick during the coronavirus outbreak and cannot work.  The bottom line is this: Online deliveries are a boon for those who cannot leave their homes, as well as small restaurants who fear going out of business. But at the same time it comes with a risk to drivers and delivery workers who fear the loss of income if they get sick.

He said such nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, or Nsaids, could aggravate symptoms of the coronavirus, and suggested that people take acetaminophen instead.

It says do not shake dirty laundry, to minimize the possibility of dispersing the virus through the air. If possible, wash items using the warmest water setting, and dry thoroughly. Dirty laundry that has been in contact with an ill person can be washed with other people’s items, the C.D.C. said.  Clean and disinfect hampers or other carts for transporting laundry, according to the guidelines for cleaning surfaces.  The need for physical distancing has prompted some laundromats to dismantle their seating areas, according to Planet Laundry, the magazine of the Coin Laundry Association. Some laundromats are asking people to stay in their cars during their wash and dry cycles, and some have removed chairs and tables to discourage people from mingling.  Commercial-grade washers and dryers operate at higher temperatures and with more rigorous mechanical action that, when combined with hot water and proper detergent use, can effectively flush contaminants from clothing better than residential machines, says the association, which represents 30,000 small businesses.","Of course, eating too much or too little in the short term is not a huge cause of concern for someone who is healthy, [experts said](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/well/how-to-manage-stress-eating-or- not-eating.html). But in the long term, moderation is important. Your body’s physical stress response may affect what kinds of foods you are reaching for, drawing you more toward carbohydrates and foods that are high in fat. Take stock of how any stress and anxiety may have affected your eating habits.  If you think you’re snacking too much when you’re not hungry, it may help to allow some time to pass and distract yourself with another activity before grabbing more food. Try to add some healthy snacks like fruits and vegetables into your routine, if you can.  If you’re regularly not eating enough, find something you can tolerate eating, or drink a calorie-rich beverage, like a protein shake. If you’re forgetting to eat entirely, schedule your mealtimes into your calendar and treat meals like any other essential appointment.

He said such nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, or Nsaids, could aggravate symptoms of the coronavirus, and suggested that people take acetaminophen instead.  Because the coronavirus is a new pathogen, there is not a lot known on how patients respond to common medications, but other experts pushed back on the French minister’s warning.  “It’s all anecdote, and fake news off the anecdotes,” said Dr. Garret FitzGerald, chair of the department of pharmacology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.

Increasingly, those agencies also have fact-checking sections on their websites, aimed at combating misinformation. One of the most troubling rumors that often spreads alongside outbreaks is who exactly has the disease — something that can lead to racial and ethnic profiling.
Nirav Shah, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said it is important to separate the disease from the person suffering from the disease. No ethnic group is more or less susceptible to the coronavirus.

But officials are increasingly worried about South Korea, where the number of cases has climbed from just a handful to more than 1,200 in the last week or so. An outbreak in Italy has infected 322 people, a worrying sign that the virus may be gaining a foothold in Europe. Seven other European nations confirmed new cases of the virus overnight. And an outbreak in Iran has infected more than 100 residents.
“The sudden increases in cases in Italy, the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Republic of Korea are deeply concerning,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Wednesday.
The Iranian outbreak has spawned new cases in Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait and Oman; the Italian outbreak is now linked to cases in Algeria, Austria, Croatia, Germany, Spain and Switzerland.
Tuesday marked a sobering moment for epidemiologists watching the virus: It was the first day that more new cases were confirmed in countries besides China than new cases in China itself, according to the WHO.
There have been 57 cases diagnosed in the United States, 36 of whom were repatriated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Most of the rest of the cases have occurred in travelers who have recently returned from China. Just two people have been infected in the United States itself.","If you received a refund in 2018 or 2019 via direct deposit to your bank account, and you did not change your bank account when you moved, you should be able to receive your rebate via direct deposit.

That would be worse than the Spanish Flu, which had a mortality rate of about 2 percent, and substantially worse than a more ordinary influenza, which kills between one in a thousand and one in ten thousand people.
But there are lots of unknowns.
First, the bad news: Only about 30,000 people have recovered from the virus, which leaves 50,000 or so still in some stage of treatment. Not all of those people will recover, so the mortality rate is expected to rise at least a little bit.
Now, the good news: That 81,191 figure represents only the number of confirmed cases.

And even if you contract this particular coronavirus, you may show few if any signs.
But if your health is poor already — especially your respiratory system — this virus is more troubling.

Those who become ill will have problems in their upper respiratory tract; those who become severely ill will have problems in the lower respiratory tract, and those can lead to really serious health concerns like pneumonia and bronchitis.","At the moment, the federal government is doing a lot of warning. The CDC has produced two dozen guidance documents for hospitals, instructions for preparedness and infection control. Crucially, they are offering guidance on preserving personal protection equipment — like masks and gloves — in a recognition that a widespread outbreak is likely to impact already-low supplies.
The Trump administration has created a task force to oversee the response, led by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. But the administration has not named a coordinator to oversee a whole-of-government response, similar to what the Obama administration did during the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa.
In other words, there is no one person whose full-time job is to oversee the government’s response.

His administration has requested $2.5 billion in emergency funding, but even Republicans have been skeptical that that’s enough to handle a widespread outbreak. Senate Democrats on Wednesday said they would seek $8.5 billion in funding.
On a state level, hospitals and public health officials are preparing for a growing number of cases. State health directors happen to be in Washington this week for an annual meeting, and many spent Wednesday walking the halls of Congress, lobbying their members to support funding.
At home, those officials are working to make sure their hospitals have the capacity they need to handle an outbreak — enough beds, enough equipment and protective gear, enough laboratory capacity to test samples they take from potentially infected victims, and enough people to run the tests.
“We’re starting to work with hospitals and EMS systems initially to make sure that they have all the capacity that they need,” Shah said of Maine’s preparations. “The public should appreciate that hospitals are used to taking care of sick people. That is what they do.”
What are the broader risks, beyond the virus?
We’ve already seen the virus’s impact in China, where factories and stores closed for days or weeks and cities have been quarantined to stop its spread. Other countries may follow China’s lead. Frieden said the outbreak is likely to cost at least $100 billion to combat globally — and maybe ten times as much, if things spiral out of control.
But as in other outbreaks, the fallout is going to extend beyond immediate health concerns. When Ebola broke out in West Africa, more people died from other, treatable diseases — malaria, cholera, even HIV — because the health systems shut down.
In this case, China is a major source of the generic drugs used in the United States, for everything from hypertension to diabetes. The virus is likely to impact supply chains, making scarce drugs that are completely unrelated to the coronavirus. Experts recommend keeping a three-month supply of any prescription drugs you take on hand in case of that disruption.
“The Chinese manufacturing issue will affect us,” says Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Preparedness at the University of Minnesota. “We’ll have a major shortfall between what will be needed and what will be available.”
Personal protective equipment, like masks and gloves, are already in short supply after a particularly bad flu season. Manufacturers are rushing to fill the gaps, but that takes time, and global demand is growing.
The Department of Health and Human Services said it has a stockpile of about 30 million masks, but says it needs 300 million to protect front-line health care workers. Those workers, who treat patients, would be most at risk of contracting the virus; more than 3,000 health care workers have been infected in China already.
The broader economic impact is also unknown, though Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, said in a note to investors Wednesday that the odds of a recession in the first half of the year now stand at 40 percent, twice what he predicted a few months ago.
“If it is a pandemic, if it does show up in Europe and the United States, then that is the prescription for a global and U.S. recession,” he said.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 are both off more than 6 percent in the last two days, the worst two-day drop in years.
There is a decent chance that major sporting events and public gatherings will be delayed or canceled. A major trade show, the Mobile World Congress, has already been canceled in Barcelona, Spain. Soccer games have been canceled in Italy, and political demonstrations are temporarily banned in Seoul, South Korea.
The organizers of the Tokyo Olympics, set for later this year, have insisted the games will go on. But a former top International Olympic Committee official, Dick Pound, cast doubt on those plans on Tuesday, saying the organizers had about a three-month window in which to decide to pull the plug.
The last time the Olympics were canceled was in 1944, when games scheduled for Italy and London were scrapped because of World War II.","[['very sick', 'widespread transmission of COVID-19 in the United States will occur', 'Older people and people with severe chronic conditions should take special precautions because they are at higher risk of developing serious', 'mild illness', 'First cases']]","[['mild to severe illness', '20', 'serious illness and death', 'severe', '.ac.uk\n\nSummary']]","[['vomit or have diarrhea', '50% of COVID-19 patients had kidney failure', 'vomit or have diarrhea', 'very sick', '1']]","[['Coronavirus disease 2019', 'Not everyone', '200,000', 'pandemic', 'pandemic']]","[['was only being', 'style choices such as smoking and drinking alcohol rather than genetic factors.

"Covid 19, What are the symptoms?","The CDC says the symptoms are similar to those of a common cold. A patient might develop a fever, a cough, and shortness of breath. At the moment, it appears someone who is infected can show symptoms as early as two days later and as long as 14 days after they have been infected, based on past coronavirus outbreaks like MERS and SARS.","The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported at least 81,191 cases of the virus as of Wednesday morning. The vast majority of those cases, 78,064, are in mainland China, and most of those are in Hubei Province, the epicenter of the outbreak.
But officials are increasingly worried about South Korea, where the number of cases has climbed from just a handful to more than 1,200 in the last week or so. An outbreak in Italy has infected 322 people, a worrying sign that the virus may be gaining a foothold in Europe. Seven other European nations confirmed new cases of the virus overnight. And an outbreak in Iran has infected more than 100 residents.
“The sudden increases in cases in Italy, the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Republic of Korea are deeply concerning,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Wednesday.
The Iranian outbreak has spawned new cases in Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait and Oman; the Italian outbreak is now linked to cases in Algeria, Austria, Croatia, Germany, Spain and Switzerland.
Tuesday marked a sobering moment for epidemiologists watching the virus: It was the first day that more new cases were confirmed in countries besides China than new cases in China itself, according to the WHO.
There have been 57 cases diagnosed in the United States, 36 of whom were repatriated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Most of the rest of the cases have occurred in travelers who have recently returned from China. Just two people have been infected in the United States itself.","[['smoking', 'depending on where they live, their travel history or other exposures', 'More cases of COVID-19 are likely to be identified in the United States in the coming days, including more instances of community spread', 'Imported cases in travelers\nCases among close contacts of a known case\nCommunity-acquired cases where the source of the infection is unknown', 'symptoms']]","[['depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress', 'depression, anxiety', 'depression', 'severe infectious diseases', 'severe']]","[['usually have mild to moderate severity', 'they are more likely to not show symptoms', 'pneumonia', 'additional deaths', 'lack of amount of  tests']]","[['COVID-19', 'Symptoms', 'Symptoms', 'Symptoms', 'Symptoms']]","[['fatigue, shortness of breath and chest pain', 'systemic hyperinflammation', 'fever, body aches, cough', 'neurological or mental health issues', 'severe lung pathology']]","[['few or no symptoms', 'mild and disappear without treatment', 'fever, cough, headache, fatigue, breathing difficulties, loss of smell, and loss of taste', 'from four to twelve weeks', 'fatigue, a cough and shortness of breath']]"
"Covid 19, How easy is it to catch the coronavirus?","Tom Frieden, who directed the CDC for eight years during the Obama administration, says it’s too early to know exactly how transmissible the virus is, how long it lives on surfaces or how many people who get the disease become really sick.
“There’s still a lot we don’t know about this infection. We don’t know how readily it spreads, we don’t know, really, what proportion of people get severely ill,” he told The Hill.
But what we do know is that the virus spreads from person to person through air droplets, much like an influenza. That makes it dissimilar from something more deadly, like Ebola, which spreads only when someone comes into contact with another person’s bodily fluids. There are signs, too, that the coronavirus can transmit even before someone shows symptoms, which is going to cause problems for health officials trying to contain its spread.
Now is a good opportunity to remind ourselves the lessons we teach toddlers: Wash your hands a lot. Cough or sneeze into your elbow. Stay at home if you’re sick. Those little steps end up having big, positive consequences.
Anyone who comes into contact with someone infected with the virus should notify their health care provider, the CDC says. Older people and young children, especially those with underlying health concerns, are at the most risk.","Coronaviruses are a relatively broad family of viruses named for the spikes that come out of a virus particle. Under a microscope, they look like a crown, or a halo — like the sun’s corona.
The current coronavirus first emerged from Wuhan, in China’s Hubei Province, most likely from a fish and animal market where humans routinely come into direct contact with animals. The virus probably jumped from an animal — we still don’t know for sure what species — to a human, a process of interspecies transmission called zoonosis.
The virus itself is called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2. The disease caused by the virus is called coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19.","[['ten days', 'depending on where they live, their travel history or other exposures', 'CDC and state and local public health laboratories are testing for the virus that causes COVID-19.

"Covid 19, What about a vaccine? Or treatments?","The coronavirus is a new phenomenon, which means scientists are only now beginning to research possible treatments or vaccines. No treatments have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, though there is a drug being tested on a patient who was repatriated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship.
That drug, Remdesivir, was first developed as a potential treatment for MERS and SARS in animals and for Ebola in humans. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is working on a study to test whether the drug would be a suitable treatment for this coronavirus.
But until a treatment is developed, someone with a severe case of the virus will be treated with supportive care — in extreme cases, with intubation tubes and breathing machines.
The real silver bullet for any epidemic or pandemic is a vaccine — and that’s going to take a while. Some in the Trump administration have promised a vaccine within the space of a few months, but that’s extremely unlikely. Instead, the top expert in the federal government, NIAID Director Anthony Fauci, has said he hopes to have a vaccine developed in the next 12 to 18 months, a relatively fast timeline by scientific standards.","If you received a refund in 2018 or 2019 via direct deposit to your bank account, and you did not change your bank account when you moved, you should be able to receive your rebate via direct deposit.

"Covid 19, Where should I get my information about the virus?","Public health officials are increasingly worried about misinformation that seems to accompany every outbreak, fueled by social media and inflammatory rhetoric.
If you hear a rumor about the virus, check it out with reputable sources — the CDC, state health agencies and the WHO all have websites with the most up-to-date information about the virus and its spread.
Increasingly, those agencies also have fact-checking sections on their websites, aimed at combating misinformation. One of the most troubling rumors that often spreads alongside outbreaks is who exactly has the disease — something that can lead to racial and ethnic profiling.
Nirav Shah, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said it is important to separate the disease from the person suffering from the disease. No ethnic group is more or less susceptible to the coronavirus.
“My concern is that fear and misinformation will spread much faster than this virus will,” Shah said in an interview Wednesday.
Bottom line: If you hear what sounds like unrealistic information, check it out before you pass it around social media.","The coronavirus relief bill is not yet law, and the IRS has yet to provide information about how it plans to implement the provision about the rebates. On the IRS’s coronavirus landing page, the agency is telling people not to call it right now and to check back for updates at a later point.

"Covid 19, What is the U.S. government doing to combat the virus?","At the moment, the federal government is doing a lot of warning. The CDC has produced two dozen guidance documents for hospitals, instructions for preparedness and infection control. Crucially, they are offering guidance on preserving personal protection equipment — like masks and gloves — in a recognition that a widespread outbreak is likely to impact already-low supplies.
The Trump administration has created a task force to oversee the response, led by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. But the administration has not named a coordinator to oversee a whole-of-government response, similar to what the Obama administration did during the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa.
In other words, there is no one person whose full-time job is to oversee the government’s response.

His administration has requested $2.5 billion in emergency funding, but even Republicans have been skeptical that that’s enough to handle a widespread outbreak. Senate Democrats on Wednesday said they would seek $8.5 billion in funding.
On a state level, hospitals and public health officials are preparing for a growing number of cases. State health directors happen to be in Washington this week for an annual meeting, and many spent Wednesday walking the halls of Congress, lobbying their members to support funding.
At home, those officials are working to make sure their hospitals have the capacity they need to handle an outbreak — enough beds, enough equipment and protective gear, enough laboratory capacity to test samples they take from potentially infected victims, and enough people to run the tests.
“We’re starting to work with hospitals and EMS systems initially to make sure that they have all the capacity that they need,” Shah said of Maine’s preparations. “The public should appreciate that hospitals are used to taking care of sick people. That is what they do.”
What are the broader risks, beyond the virus?
We’ve already seen the virus’s impact in China, where factories and stores closed for days or weeks and cities have been quarantined to stop its spread. Other countries may follow China’s lead. Frieden said the outbreak is likely to cost at least $100 billion to combat globally — and maybe ten times as much, if things spiral out of control.
But as in other outbreaks, the fallout is going to extend beyond immediate health concerns. When Ebola broke out in West Africa, more people died from other, treatable diseases — malaria, cholera, even HIV — because the health systems shut down.
In this case, China is a major source of the generic drugs used in the United States, for everything from hypertension to diabetes. The virus is likely to impact supply chains, making scarce drugs that are completely unrelated to the coronavirus. Experts recommend keeping a three-month supply of any prescription drugs you take on hand in case of that disruption.
“The Chinese manufacturing issue will affect us,” says Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Preparedness at the University of Minnesota. “We’ll have a major shortfall between what will be needed and what will be available.”
Personal protective equipment, like masks and gloves, are already in short supply after a particularly bad flu season. Manufacturers are rushing to fill the gaps, but that takes time, and global demand is growing.
The Department of Health and Human Services said it has a stockpile of about 30 million masks, but says it needs 300 million to protect front-line health care workers. Those workers, who treat patients, would be most at risk of contracting the virus; more than 3,000 health care workers have been infected in China already.
The broader economic impact is also unknown, though Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, said in a note to investors Wednesday that the odds of a recession in the first half of the year now stand at 40 percent, twice what he predicted a few months ago.
“If it is a pandemic, if it does show up in Europe and the United States, then that is the prescription for a global and U.S. recession,” he said.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 are both off more than 6 percent in the last two days, the worst two-day drop in years.
There is a decent chance that major sporting events and public gatherings will be delayed or canceled. A major trade show, the Mobile World Congress, has already been canceled in Barcelona, Spain. Soccer games have been canceled in Italy, and political demonstrations are temporarily banned in Seoul, South Korea.
The organizers of the Tokyo Olympics, set for later this year, have insisted the games will go on. But a former top International Olympic Committee official, Dick Pound, cast doubt on those plans on Tuesday, saying the organizers had about a three-month window in which to decide to pull the plug.

"Covid 19, Can people get checks even if they haven’t filed a tax return in recent years?","In cases where people haven’t filed tax returns but receive Social Security benefits or railroad retirement benefits, the IRS can look at statements about those benefits to help get the checks to those people.

For people who have not filed a 2018 or 2019 tax return and do not receive Social Security or railroad retirement benefits, there is an incentive to promptly file a tax return to ensure that the IRS can reach them to distribute the money to them this year. 

People who do not file tax returns are typically low-income. For example, the IRS requires married couples with both spouses under 65 to file returns for 2019 if their gross income was at least $24,400. That threshold is raised to $27,000 in cases where both spouses were 65 or older.

"Covid 19, How does COVID-19 spread?","People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.","Can a person cured of Covid-19, get infected again? This is a viral infection. Like swine flu or H1N1, if you are exposed to it, you can get infected again. But once you get the infection, the human system develops antibodies to fight the virus which is why in case you contract the infection again it is likely to be less severe than before. So, if after getting cured for Covid-19, you end up getting infected again, you might have milder symptoms.","[['depending on where they live, their travel history or other exposures', 'community', 'coronavirus', 'ten days', 'community']]","[['droplets and contact', 'through human-to-human contact', 'expanding its catchment into surrounding regions and other countries', 'from person-to-person', 'airborne, droplet and contact routes']]","[['all over Turkey', 'respiratory droplets', 'Flattening the curve', 'misinformation', 'Myanmar has launched a community lockdown']]","[['pandemic', 'CDC', 'pandemic', 'pandemic', 'pandemic']]",[[]],[[]]

"Covid 19, What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?","You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:

 1: Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.

 2: Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.

 3: Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.

 4: Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.

 5: Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.

 6: Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places - especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease. Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.","Can I go out in my vehicle to pick up someone who is stranded somewhere?

2: Before touching the mask, clean hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water

3: Take the mask and inspect it for tears or holes.

4: Orient which side is the top side (where the metal strip is).

5: Ensure the proper side of the mask faces outwards (the coloured side).

6: Place the mask to your face. Pinch the metal strip or stiff edge of the mask so it moulds to the shape of your nose.

7: Pull down the mask's bottom so it covers your mouth and your chin.

8: After use, take off the mask; remove the elastic loops from behind the ears while keeping the mask away from your face and clothes, to avoid touching potentially contaminated surfaces of the mask.

9: Discard the mask in a closed bin immediately after use.

10: Perform hand hygiene after touching or discarding the mask - Use alcohol-based hand rub or, if visibly soiled, wash your hands with soap and water.","How deadly is it?
That won't be known until large studies are done to test big groups of people to see how many have been infected and with or without symptoms. Scientists have estimated the fatality rate from less than 1% to as high as 4% among cases diagnosed so far, depending on location. Flu kills about 0.1% of those it infects, so the new virus seems about 10 times more lethal, the National Institutes of Health's Dr. Anthony Fauci told Congress last week.

"Covid 19, Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?","The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.","Will it go away in the summer?
Flu fades each spring and the new virus may do the same, Fauci said last week in a podcast with a journal editor. ""I am hoping that as we get into the warmer weather we will see a decline that will give us a chance to get our preparedness up to speed,"" Fauci said. But that, too, is far from certain. ""We have to assume that the virus will continue to have the capacity to spread, and it's a false hope to say yes, it will just disappear in the summertime like influenza,"" said Dr. Michael Ryan, the World Health Organization's emergencies chief.

SARS was more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003.","The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don't develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.

2: Before touching the mask, clean hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water

3: Take the mask and inspect it for tears or holes.

4: Orient which side is the top side (where the metal strip is).

5: Ensure the proper side of the mask faces outwards (the coloured side).

6: Place the mask to your face. Pinch the metal strip or stiff edge of the mask so it moulds to the shape of your nose.

7: Pull down the mask's bottom so it covers your mouth and your chin.

8: After use, take off the mask; remove the elastic loops from behind the ears while keeping the mask away from your face and clothes, to avoid touching potentially contaminated surfaces of the mask.

9: Discard the mask in a closed bin immediately after use.

10: Perform hand hygiene after touching or discarding the mask - Use alcohol-based hand rub or, if visibly soiled, wash your hands with soap and water.","[['Safe patient transport', 'depending on where they live, their travel history or other exposures.

"Covid 19, For how long will the lockdown continue?","For how long will the lockdown continue?
A majority of the states have issued guidelines until March 31, however, there are some instances where advisories have been issued for shut down of services till mid-April.","You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:

 1: Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.

 2: Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.

 3: Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.

 4: Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.

 5: Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.

 6: Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places - especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease. Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.","[['ten days', '15 Days', '14 days', 'up to 14 days', 'More cases of COVID-19 are likely to be identified in the United States in the coming days, including more instances of community spread.

In a report last week on the first 12 patients in the US, seven were hospitalized; most had underlying health problems and got worse during the second week of illness. In China, slightly more males have been diagnosed with COVID-19 than females, which might be because roughly half of Chinese men smoke but only 5% of females do, Frieden said.

Most spread is from droplets produced when an infected person coughs, which are inhaled by people nearby. Transmission from touching contaminated surfaces hasn't been shown yet, though recent tests by US scientists suggest it's possible -- one reason they recommend washing your hands and not touching your face. The virus can live in the air for several hours, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. Cleaning surfaces with solutions containing diluted bleach should kill it. ""While we are still learning about the biology of this virus, it does not appear that there is a major risk of spread through sweat,"" said Julie Fischer, a Georgetown University microbiologist. The biggest concern about going to the gym is infected people coughing on others, or contaminating shared surfaces or equipment, she said. Consider avoiding large classes and peak hours and don't go if you're coughing or feverish, she suggests. The risk of virus transmission from food servers is the same risk as transmission from other infected people, but ""one of the concerns in that food servers, like others facing stark choices about insurance and paychecks, may be pressured to work even if they are sick,"" she said.","Will petrol pumps work?

"Covid 19, Can infected people who recover get it again?","Can infected people who recover get it again?
It's not known. A few reports from China say some people had COVID-19, recovered and then fell ill again. It's unclear if that's a relapse, a new infection, or a case where the person never fully recovered in the first place. Scientists at the at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle say the 30,000-letter genetic code of the virus changes by one letter every 15 days. It's not known how many of these changes would be needed for the virus to seem different enough to the immune system of someone who had a previous version of it for it to cause a fresh infection. Fauci told Congress on Thursday that it was unlikely that someone could get reinfected. ""We haven't formally proved it, but it is strongly likely that that's the case,"" he said. ""Because if this acts like any other virus, once you recover, you won't get reinfected.""","It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses. Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment).

"Covid 19, If a person tests positive for influenza, they are not tested for coronavirus. Could a person have both?","Yes, a person could have both. This was the case for one patient in China, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The 69-year-old man in Wuhan had both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus. Doctors initially diagnosed the man with the flu and later diagnosed the coronavirus.

Doctors studying the patient said the case ""suggests that COVID-19 might be underdiagnosed because of false-negative tests for upper respiratory specimens or co-infection with other respiratory viruses. Broader viral testing might be needed.""

Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, agrees.

""I don’t like that people are doing flu tests and saying therefore it’s not coronavirus,"" Hotez said. ""Traditionally, for flu, we know it’s possible to get other co-infectious with other viruses.""","No. While shortness of breath is among the most common symptoms of the virus,according to the CDC, that diagnosis does not necessarily involve holding alarge breath for 10 seconds.

"Covid 19, Can testing show if someone has had coronavirus and then recovered?","Yes, but it depends on what kind of test you do. ""If you do an antibody test, in theory it could show that you had the virus and then recovered,"" Hotez said.

To do an antibody test, you'd need to have blood drawn. But coronavirus tests in the U.S. aren't being done this way.","Depending on the type of surface, the virus can stay on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days, according to the WHO. A recent study by scientists in the U.S. found that viable virus could be detected up to three hours later in the air, up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. 

However, a subsequent report from the CDC found that genetic material from the virus can live on surfaces for more than two weeks. The CDC found traces of the virus' RNA, not the coronavirus itself, on surfaces in the cabins of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship – 17 days after passengers had left the cabins.

It's possible that you can become infected if you touch your face after touching a surface or object that has the virus on it, according to the CDC. But scientists don't think surfaces are the main way that the virus spreads; the most common form of infection is from respiratory droplets spread by a person's cough or sneeze, the CDC reports.

Meanwhile, the WHO says it is very unlikely that the virus will persist on a surface after being moved, traveled and exposed to different conditions and temperatures. That means the virus cannot spread through goods manufactured in China or any country reporting coronavirus cases.

At the same time, the WHO is reportedly encouraging people to use as many digital payment options as possible. Viruses can survive on hard surfaces like coins for days in some cases. U.S dollars, a blend of fabric and paper, are harder for viruses to stick to.","[['Most people have mild illness and are able to recover at home without medical care', 'CDC and state and local public health laboratories are testing for the virus that causes COVID-19.

However, a subsequent report from the CDC found that genetic material from the virus can live on surfaces for more than two weeks.

"Covid 19, What is involved in testing for the coronavirus? Is it the same as when they do a nasal swab for influenza?","To collect a sample for a diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the COVID-19 disease, doctors typically use the same method of collection as they would for influenza: a nasopharyngeal swab. For this swab, a tiny Q-tip on plastic or a wire stem is put up your nose about 3 or 4 inches.

""I've had it done, and it's mildly uncomfortable for a few seconds,"" said Gregory Poland, director of the Mayo Clinic’s Vaccine Research Group.

A doctor may also do a throat swab. In some cases, if you have a ""wet"" cough, a doctor may also have you cough up some phlegm into a collection cup. These specimen are then packed with ice and shipped to a lab for testing.

To determine if someone has recovered from the coronavirus, at least two different nasal swabs taken at least 24 hours apart must test negative, Poland said.","A study of more than 72,000 cases in mainland China found that at least one person between ten and 19 years of age had died, but no one younger than ten had died.

"Covid 19, How long does the virus live on an object like a dollar bill?","Depending on the type of surface, the virus can stay on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days, according to the WHO. A recent study by scientists in the U.S. found that viable virus could be detected up to three hours later in the air, up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. 

However, a subsequent report from the CDC found that genetic material from the virus can live on surfaces for more than two weeks. The CDC found traces of the virus' RNA, not the coronavirus itself, on surfaces in the cabins of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship – 17 days after passengers had left the cabins.

It's possible that you can become infected if you touch your face after touching a surface or object that has the virus on it, according to the CDC. But scientists don't think surfaces are the main way that the virus spreads; the most common form of infection is from respiratory droplets spread by a person's cough or sneeze, the CDC reports.

Meanwhile, the WHO says it is very unlikely that the virus will persist on a surface after being moved, traveled and exposed to different conditions and temperatures. That means the virus cannot spread through goods manufactured in China or any country reporting coronavirus cases.

At the same time, the WHO is reportedly encouraging people to use as many digital payment options as possible. Viruses can survive on hard surfaces like coins for days in some cases.

While fever is one of the most common symptoms, it's not productive to take your temperature every day, Poland said.

""That's like taking your blood pressure four times a day for no particular good reason. I’d probably not do that unless there's a reason to do it. For example, if you felt feverish, or if you traveled to a high-risk area, or if you had contact with somebody (infected),"" he said.","No, for several reasons, says Peter Hotez, dean of the National School ofTropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine.While a protective antibody is generated in those who are infected,[scientists are not yetsure](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/03/12/coronavirus-reader-questions-answered-symptoms-testing-elderly/5012457002/) whether thatimmunity will last for a short period of time, for years or for life.

While more people in the U.S. were infected by and died after contracting the flu in 1968 and 2009, the new coronavirus has infected and killed more people in the U.S. than did SARS, MERS, Ebola or Zika.

By comparison, the 1968 ""Hong Kong flu"" pandemic was caused by an influenza A virus and killed an estimated 1 million people worldwide, with about 100,000 deaths in the U.S., according to the CDC. The 2009 ""swine flu"" pandemic was caused by an H1N1 subtype of the influenza A virus and killed at least 151,000 people worldwide during the first year the virus circulated, with more than 12,000 deaths in the U.S., according to the CDC.

"Covid 19, Will I get paid if I can't work?","This may depend on whether you're permanent or casual.
Usually, if you are asked by your employer not to work (assuming you're a full-time or part-time employee), you would be entitled to be paid.
However, that typically applies to natural disasters, and not a pandemic like COVID-19.
Experts say that, unless there's a special clause in your Enterprise Agreement, employers may be able to stand employees down without pay.
This will vary with each employer, so it's best to check with them.
For casual workers and independent contractors, including gig economy workers, the situation is potentially more grim.
According to Fair Work, if you're a casual employee needing to look after a family member who is sick with coronavirus, or suffering an unexpected emergency, you are entitled to just two days of unpaid carer's leave per occasion.
After that, you'll need to contact your employer to work out an arrangement.
Casual employees and independent contractors may qualify for the sickness allowance, a means-tested payment that provides up to $560 for singles without children and $1,010 for couples out of work due to illness.
The Government has waived the one-week waiting period to access the allowance.
The Federal Government has increased existing payments for welfare allowances, and expanding eligibility criteria for new applicants, for six months to late September.

Person-to-person transmission is most likely between people in close contact, about 6 feet. When a person infected with novel coronavirus sneezes or coughs, respiratory droplets could land on people nearby or could possibly be inhaled by those people.

While the virus can be transmitted by touching objects or surfaces contaminated with COVID-19, health experts don't currently believe that's primarily how it's transmitted.","A study of previous coronaviruses found human coronaviruses could theoretically last on surfaces at room temperature for up to nine days.

The type of surface, because viruses survive on shiny, hard surfaces longer than soft ones;
Whether it is exposed to sunlight, because UV radiation kills viruses; and
Temperature and humidity, because viruses last longer at lower temperatures and lower humidity.","[['depending on where they live, their travel history or other exposures', 'how it is transmitted', 'Imported cases in travelers\nCases among close contacts of a known case\nCommunity-acquired cases where the source of the infection is unknown', 'More than half of the U.S. is seeing some level of community spread of COVID-19', 'coronavirus.']]","[['person-to-person', 'person-to-person', 'person-to-person', 'human-to-human', 'close contact with an infected person']]","[['urine or feces', 'Morocco via Italy', '73', 'injection', 'flu']]","[['CDC site for COVID-19', '2019', '.', 'India.', '19']]",[[]],[[]]
"Covid 19, I live in the United States. What should I do?","While specific guidelines vary from city to city, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has advised that Americans practice social distancing, and stay home, avoid mass gatherings and maintain 6 feet between themselves and others whenever possible. These efforts are intended to help ""flatten the curve,"" which means distributing the number of coronavirus cases over a longer period of time, to avoid overwhelming the health care system.

Americans should continue to uphold proper flu season hygiene. Wash your hands often, stay home if you're sick and cough or sneeze into your elbow rather than your hand.

If schools in your district have not yet closed, Dr. William Schaffner, medical director for the nonprofit National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, suggested sitting down and outlining a plan for how your family might handle schools and businesses closing. Does an older relative take prescription medication? Now might be a good time to stockpile at least two weeks' worth.

Call schools and ask if there are plans for remote schooling -- as some schools have done. Figure out a childcare plan in the event schools close, and ask about remote working options. Asking more questions now hopefully means asking fewer later.","Not unless you are the one who is sick.

The CDC doesn’t currently recommend any healthy person wear a mask and doctors warn fiddling with putting on and taking off a mask could backfire by exposing your hands to your face.

""Surgical masks fit rather loosely around the face and are not constructed, nor thick enough, to prevent infection,"" Schaffner said.

While they could have a modest benefit, any protection they provide is likely more psychological than scientific. N-95 masks, which hospitals use, are expensive and aren't easy to wear, meaning they're not a practical option for everyday use. As health officials have noted, masks should be reserved for the health care workers, not the general public.

In recent weeks, N-95 masks have grown so scarce that the White House is asking Americans who have them, as well as construction companies, to donate them to hospitals, so that health care workers aren't forced to treat COVID-19 patients without a mask, which puts them at risk for contracting the virus themselves.

""The other thing a mask can do is give you a false sense of security, and that's not helpful,"" said Dr. Michael Merson, a visiting professor at NYU's School of Global Public Health and a professor at Duke University. Masks work better at preventing people who are coughing and sneezing from spreading respiratory droplets and infecting others, but ""those people who are sick should probably be at home anyway.""

"Covid 19, Should I be tested for the virus?","It's not completely up to you.

The CDC recently rolled out new guidance, allowing anyone to be tested for COVID-19 without restrictions, as long as their doctor approves. Testing is on the rise in the U.S., but experts say it is not yet enough.

If you have traveled to an area with local transmission or have been in close contact with someone who has been exposed to the virus, and develop symptoms, such as cough or fever, your health care provider can work with the local health department to determine whether you should be tested for COVID-19.

If you have symptoms, but no travel history to an outbreak area, you could go to a clinic and have a rapid test done to rule out more common viruses, such as influenza, Merson advised.

If you have mild symptoms and are worried that you might have COVID-19, call your doctor or local health department instead of going to a clinic or doctor's office without an appointment, to ensure you aren't potentially exposing others to the virus. If you have severe breathing problems, seek medical attention or call 911 immediately, recommends Dr. Jennifer Ashton, ABC News’ chief medical correspondent.

You should let the person you speak with know that you have respiratory problems and need to be isolated and seen right away.","Concerned.

""It's hard,"" said Dr. Stanley Perlman, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Iowa, who described receiving a text message from his son asking whether he should stock up on canned goods.

""I would be inclined not to,"" Perlman said. ""We know from other cases that it actually tends to make things worse, because people stock up and then we don't have anything.""

COVID-19 appears to be more fatal than the flu, with some studies pegging COVID-19's fatality rate at around 3.4%, while the flu's fatality rate is less than 1%. Still, experts anticipate that COVID-19's mortality rate will fall when more people with mild symptoms are diagnosed with the virus. Typically, the sickest people tend to seek health care treatment first. Compared to past coronaviruses, such as SARS and MERS, however, most COVID-19 cases are mild.

""For most people, it's going to mean no disease or a mild illness,"" Merson said.

"Covid 19, Is the outbreak a pandemic?","Yes.

The World Health organization defines a pandemic as ""the worldwide spread of a new disease,"" and on March 11, the WHO's director general announced that COVID-19 met those criteria.

Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO's director general, stressed that the designation doesn't mean that citizens should stop trying to contain the virus.

""Find, isolate, test and treat every case, and trace every contact,"" he said. ""Ready your hospitals. Protect and train your health care workers.""

For the United States, community transmission in several cities and a growing number of cases that aren't able to be traced to travel or contact with individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 makes it probable that there will be extensive spread here.

""A lot of us have been sitting back and watching this from a distant place,"" Schaffner noted, adding that the game has changed in recent days. He cautioned against ""running around like a chicken with its head cut off,"" and recommended thinking ahead. A large increase in cases in your community could mean school closures or other changes to your routine.

""Be prudent and be prepared to participate as much as you can in social distancing when that becomes the order of the day,"" he said. If health authorities advise against mass gatherings, for example, don't make a fuss.

""It shouldn't panic you,"" Schaffner said. ""But it should get your attention.""","The first cases of COVID-19 were believed to be linked to a live-animal market in China, but the virus has since been spreading from person to person.

Person-to-person transmission is most likely between people in close contact, about 6 feet. When a person infected with novel coronavirus sneezes or coughs, respiratory droplets could land on people nearby or could possibly be inhaled by those people.

"Covid 19, How concerned should I be -- how does COVID-19 compare to the flu?","Concerned.

Stay on top of CDC updates and guidance, as well as from state and local health departments. Take the time to sit down and plan for what you'll do if local transmission of the virus occurs in your city.

Even the experts aren't completely sure what's going to happen.

""It's hard,"" said Dr. Stanley Perlman, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Iowa, who described receiving a text message from his son asking whether he should stock up on canned goods.

""I would be inclined not to,"" Perlman said. ""We know from other cases that it actually tends to make things worse, because people stock up and then we don't have anything.""

COVID-19 appears to be more fatal than the flu, with some studies pegging COVID-19's fatality rate at around 3.4%, while the flu's fatality rate is less than 1%. Still, experts anticipate that COVID-19's mortality rate will fall when more people with mild symptoms are diagnosed with the virus. Typically, the sickest people tend to seek health care treatment first. Compared to past coronaviruses, such as SARS and MERS, however, most COVID-19 cases are mild.

""For most people, it's going to mean no disease or a mild illness,"" Merson said. Unfortunately, that mildness could also explain why COVID-19 is spreading more rapidly than highly fatal diseases do. HIV, for example, ""was very fatal, but hard to transmit,"" he added.","We don't know.

Because COVID-19 is a new virus, we don't know whether pregnant women are more susceptible than the general population.

Reports from China include children who have contracted COVID-19, but those children typically had very mild symptoms and the majority of cases were diagnosed in adults.

The World Health organization defines a pandemic as ""the worldwide spread of a new disease,"" and on March 11, the WHO's director general announced that COVID-19 met those criteria.

Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO's director general, stressed that the designation doesn't mean that citizens should stop trying to contain the virus.

""Find, isolate, test and treat every case, and trace every contact,"" he said. ""Ready your hospitals. Protect and train your health care workers.""

For the United States, community transmission in several cities and a growing number of cases that aren't able to be traced to travel or contact with individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 makes it probable that there will be extensive spread here.

""A lot of us have been sitting back and watching this from a distant place,"" Schaffner noted, adding that the game has changed in recent days. He cautioned against ""running around like a chicken with its head cut off,"" and recommended thinking ahead. A large increase in cases in your community could mean school closures or other changes to your routine.

Person-to-person transmission is most likely between people in close contact, about 6 feet. When a person infected with novel coronavirus sneezes or coughs, respiratory droplets could land on people nearby or could possibly be inhaled by those people.

While the virus can be transmitted by touching objects or surfaces contaminated with COVID-19, health experts don't currently believe that's primarily how it's transmitted.","While specific guidelines vary from city to city, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has advised that Americans practice social distancing, and stay home, avoid mass gatherings and maintain 6 feet between themselves and others whenever possible.

"Covid 19, Should I wear a face mask?","Not unless you are the one who is sick.

The CDC doesn’t currently recommend any healthy person wear a mask and doctors warn fiddling with putting on and taking off a mask could backfire by exposing your hands to your face.

""Surgical masks fit rather loosely around the face and are not constructed, nor thick enough, to prevent infection,"" Schaffner said.

While they could have a modest benefit, any protection they provide is likely more psychological than scientific. N-95 masks, which hospitals use, are expensive and aren't easy to wear, meaning they're not a practical option for everyday use. As health officials have noted, masks should be reserved for the health care workers, not the general public.

In recent weeks, N-95 masks have grown so scarce that the White House is asking Americans who have them, as well as construction companies, to donate them to hospitals, so that health care workers aren't forced to treat COVID-19 patients without a mask, which puts them at risk for contracting the virus themselves.

""The other thing a mask can do is give you a false sense of security, and that's not helpful,"" said Dr. Michael Merson, a visiting professor at NYU's School of Global Public Health and a professor at Duke University. Masks work better at preventing people who are coughing and sneezing from spreading respiratory droplets and infecting others, but ""those people who are sick should probably be at home anyway.""

The CDC recently rolled out new guidance, allowing anyone to be tested for COVID-19 without restrictions, as long as their doctor approves. Testing is on the rise in the U.S., but experts say it is not yet enough.

If you have traveled to an area with local transmission or have been in close contact with someone who has been exposed to the virus, and develop symptoms, such as cough or fever, your health care provider can work with the local health department to determine whether you should be tested for COVID-19.

If you have symptoms, but no travel history to an outbreak area, you could go to a clinic and have a rapid test done to rule out more common viruses, such as influenza, Merson advised.

If you have mild symptoms and are worried that you might have COVID-19, call your doctor or local health department instead of going to a clinic or doctor's office without an appointment, to ensure you aren't potentially exposing others to the virus. If you have severe breathing problems, seek medical attention or call 911 immediately, recommends Dr. Jennifer Ashton, ABC News’ chief medical correspondent.

"Covid 19, Should I cancel my upcoming trip to Europe or Asia?","The decision may be out of your hands.

The U.S. State Department has a Level 4 global health advisory in place, which says that Americans should avoid all international travel because of COVID-19.

""In countries where commercial departure options remain available, U.S. citizens who live in the United States should arrange for immediate return to the United States, unless they are prepared to remain abroad for an indefinite period,"" the advisory reads.

The situation is fluid and rapidly evolving, so you should check the State Department's website often and use that information to inform your decisions.

Many countries experiencing outbreaks are implementing travel restrictions, mandatory quarantines and border closures with little advanced notice, and some Americans traveling in those countries have found themselves stranded, without a way to get home. 

If you are in a high-risk group, meaning you are an older person, or have an underlying medical condition, ""you should now be thinking about social distancing,"" Schaffner advised.

""Part of that is thinking really hard about whether you need to get on an airplane,"" he said. ""I think this is a good time to postpone those trips.""

Even if your trip is to a low-risk area, traveling on a plane will mean being in an enclosed space with fellow travelers.

Testing methods may include a blood test, a swab test inside your nose or in the back of your throat, or a sputum test, which examines a mix of saliva and mucus.

Remember, you may still need a GP referral before attending new clinics, so be sure to check first.","[['Asia', 'Does the patient have recent travel from an affected area?\nHas the patient been in close contact with someone with COVID-19 or with patients with pneumonia of unknown cause', 'depending on where they live, their travel history or other exposures', '.', '.']]","[['banning all public events of more than 100 participants', 'ng together are allowed outside\nordered together.

"Covid 19, Is the outbreak a pandemic?","Yes.

The World Health organization defines a pandemic as ""the worldwide spread of a new disease,"" and on March 11, the WHO's director general announced that COVID-19 met those criteria.

Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO's director general, stressed that the designation doesn't mean that citizens should stop trying to contain the virus.

""Find, isolate, test and treat every case, and trace every contact,"" he said. ""Ready your hospitals. Protect and train your health care workers.""

For the United States, community transmission in several cities and a growing number of cases that aren't able to be traced to travel or contact with individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 makes it probable that there will be extensive spread here.

""A lot of us have been sitting back and watching this from a distant place,"" Schaffner noted, adding that the game has changed in recent days. He cautioned against ""running around like a chicken with its head cut off,"" and recommended thinking ahead. A large increase in cases in your community could mean school closures or other changes to your routine.

""Be prudent and be prepared to participate as much as you can in social distancing when that becomes the order of the day,"" he said. If health authorities advise against mass gatherings, for example, don't make a fuss.

""It shouldn't panic you,"" Schaffner said. ""But it should get your attention.""","Not unless you are the one who is sick.

The CDC doesn’t currently recommend any healthy person wear a mask and doctors warn fiddling with putting on and taking off a mask could backfire by exposing your hands to your face.

""Surgical masks fit rather loosely around the face and are not constructed, nor thick enough, to prevent infection,"" Schaffner said.

While they could have a modest benefit, any protection they provide is likely more psychological than scientific. N-95 masks, which hospitals use, are expensive and aren't easy to wear, meaning they're not a practical option for everyday use. As health officials have noted, masks should be reserved for the health care workers, not the general public.

In recent weeks, N-95 masks have grown so scarce that the White House is asking Americans who have them, as well as construction companies, to donate them to hospitals, so that health care workers aren't forced to treat COVID-19 patients without a mask, which puts them at risk for contracting the virus themselves.

""The other thing a mask can do is give you a false sense of security, and that's not helpful,"" said Dr. Michael Merson, a visiting professor at NYU's School of Global Public Health and a professor at Duke University. Masks work better at preventing people who are coughing and sneezing from spreading respiratory droplets and infecting others, but ""those people who are sick should probably be at home anyway.""

""I would be inclined not to,"" Perlman said. ""We know from other cases that it actually tends to make things worse, because people stock up and then we don't have anything.""

COVID-19 appears to be more fatal than the flu, with some studies pegging COVID-19's fatality rate at around 3.4%, while the flu's fatality rate is less than 1%. Still, experts anticipate that COVID-19's mortality rate will fall when more people with mild symptoms are diagnosed with the virus.

As local trusts may place restrictions on visitors, partners may not be able to go to antenatal appointments, or stay with women on antenatal or postnatal wards. But this doesn't mean they cannot attend the birth, as long as they feel well.

Some NHS trusts will allow only one birth partner to be in attendance, where previously they had allowed two. There were reports that others had banned partners' attendance altogether, before doing a U-turn on official advice.

Understandably, some pregnant women feel nervous about going into a hospital in case it increases their risk of catching the coronavirus.

Maternity units are carrying out some consultations over the phone or via video link, but some in-person visits with the midwife are essential for the wellbeing of the mother and baby, the Royal College of Midwives says.

"Covid 19, Can you catch coronavirus from your dog or cat? - Javed","This is highly unlikely to happen, according to scientists and vets.
There have been no cases of pets passing the coronavirus to humans, and the same was true during the Sars outbreak in 2003, when there was not a single case of pet-to-human transmission.
Sars is a very closely-related virus to the coronavirus that causes Covid-19.
It is possible that a pet's fur could become contaminated if an infected person has previously touched or stroked the animal.
As always, you should wash your hands with soap and water after handling an animal or its lead, and avoid touching your nose and mouth.
The novel coronavirus is thought to have originated in wildlife and passed to humans via a live animal market, but it is likely the first people infected actually ate infected meat. Since then it has been spread from person to person.
However, a Malayan tiger at the Bronx Zoo recently tested positive for the virus. She was thought to have been infected by an asymptomatic zookeeper, so there is evidence of human-to-animal transmission.","There may be a chance some blood types have a higher risk of getting a serious dose of Covid-19 than others, a small early study suggests.

Researchers assessed 2,173 coronavirus hospital patients in Shenzhen and Wuhan in China, where the outbreak originated.

They found patients with A blood group types were more likely to have been hospitalised than average, while those with an O blood group type were less likely.

In the local population, 32% had a type A blood group, compared with 38% of those in hospital. Meanwhile, 34% of residents had type 0 blood, compared with 26% in hospital.

However, this study has not yet been peer reviewed and only covered a small area, so these links may be coincidental. Everyone should be doing all they can to avoid catching the virus and passing it on to others, regardless of their blood type.","[['depending on where they live, their travel history or other exposures.

"Covid 19, How do you practise safe sex during a pandemic?","If you live with your partner, they count as being part of your household.

If one person does have symptoms, they should be self-isolating in a separate room.
Using contraception such as condoms won't alter your risk of catching the virus, as having sex will bring you into close physical contact anyway.
""If you are going to touch each other's genitals it's likely that you will potentially be kissing at the same time - and we know the virus is passed through saliva,"" Dr Alex George told the BBC's Newsbeat.
""Essentially, any possibility of transfer of coronavirus - from your mouth to your hands, to genitals, to someone else's nose or mouth - increases the risk of passing on coronavirus.""","There are currently no formal restrictions on moving house, although the government has strongly advised against it where possible.

Smoking tobacco or illegal drugs damages the lungs and airways, causing a range of respiratory problems. The coronavirus attacks the respiratory system, placing smokers at greater risk.
There is also evidence it suppresses and harms the immune system, with smokers twice as likely to catch pneumonia as non-smokers.
Smokers are also likely to regularly touch their mouth, increasing their risk of infection.

He added: ""Most of the people who get a fever get tired. A lot of the people who get tired get achy muscles and a lot of those people get a cough. One of the things that doesn't seem to be very common is sneezing.""
The WHO says the illness it causes is ""generally mild, especially for children and young adults"", but around one in five people who get the virus become seriously ill and develop difficulty breathing.
Dr Chris added: ""If you have difficulty breathing, go to hospital.""","The British Retail Consortium says retailers and their suppliers are continuing to work to the highest standards of hygiene when handling products, and are observing safety processes set by the Food Standards Agency and Public Health England.

"Covid 19, Can pets get coronavirus?","There is some evidence that pets can be infected with the coronavirus - but it is thought they cannot infect people with it.
However, it's still important to protect yourself from bacteria that can pass between pets and humans - that means washing hands.
British Veterinary Association president Daniella Dos Santoshas suggested another reason why people should practise good hand hygiene if they have animals.
She explained: ""An animal's fur could carry the virus for a time if a pet were to have come into contact with someone who was sick.""
Doctor James is a vet on CBBC show The Pets Factor, and he's been answering questions about whether animals can catch the virus, or even if they should wear face masks for protection.","Covid-19 is primarily spread in tiny droplets released from the nose and mouth of an infected person as they cough. The most common way for the virus to be transmitted appears to be through close contact with an infected person.

However, evidence suggests the virus can live for an extended time outside of the body, including on surfaces. If you touch a contaminated surface and then your nose or mouth, there's a possibility you could become infected.

A study published last month suggests the virus survives longest on plastic and stainless steel surfaces - up to two to three days - and can live for up to 24 hours on cardboard. However, over that time the virus is likely to become less powerful.

Where possible, it is a good idea to either disinfect the packaging with kitchen spray or discard it before washing your hands with soap and water.

For items like a newspaper that can't be washed, the likelihood of transmission is low, but it still makes sense to practise regular hand washing.

Bearing in mind the virus's durability, it's also worth regularly disinfecting plastic and stainless steel surfaces such as door handles.","[['.

"Covid 19, How long does the virus live on different surfaces?

The most common way for the virus to be transmitted appears to be through close contact with an infected person.

However, evidence suggests the virus can live for an extended time outside of the body, including on surfaces. If you touch a contaminated surface and then your nose or mouth, there's a possibility you could become infected.

A study published last month suggests the virus survives longest on plastic and stainless steel surfaces - up to two to three days - and can live for up to 24 hours on cardboard. However, over that time the virus is likely to become less powerful.

Where possible, it is a good idea to either disinfect the packaging with kitchen spray or discard it before washing your hands with soap and water.

"Covid 19, What is the current policy on birthing partners?","Expectant mothers should be encouraged to have a birth partner with them during labour and birth, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists says, unless the partner is showing symptoms of coronavirus.

As local trusts may place restrictions on visitors, partners may not be able to go to antenatal appointments, or stay with women on antenatal or postnatal wards. But this doesn't mean they cannot attend the birth, as long as they feel well.

Some NHS trusts will allow only one birth partner to be in attendance, where previously they had allowed two. There were reports that others had banned partners' attendance altogether, before doing a U-turn on official advice.

Understandably, some pregnant women feel nervous about going into a hospital in case it increases their risk of catching the coronavirus.

Maternity units are carrying out some consultations over the phone or via video link, but some in-person visits with the midwife are essential for the wellbeing of the mother and baby, the Royal College of Midwives says.

It adds that home births may no longer be available in some local areas, mainly due to staff and ambulance shortages, but maternity wards are being kept as separate from Covid-19 treatment areas as possible.","This is highly unlikely to happen, according to scientists and vets.
There have been no cases of pets passing the coronavirus to humans, and the same was true during the Sars outbreak in 2003, when there was not a single case of pet-to-human transmission.
Sars is a very closely-related virus to the coronavirus that causes Covid-19.
It is possible that a pet's fur could become contaminated if an infected person has previously touched or stroked the animal.
As always, you should wash your hands with soap and water after handling an animal or its lead, and avoid touching your nose and mouth.
The novel coronavirus is thought to have originated in wildlife and passed to humans via a live animal market, but it is likely the first people infected actually ate infected meat. Since then it has been spread from person to person.
However, a Malayan tiger at the Bronx Zoo recently tested positive for the virus. She was thought to have been infected by an asymptomatic zookeeper, so there is evidence of human-to-animal transmission.","[['Does the patient have recent travel from an affected area?\nHas the patient been in close contact with someone with COVID-19 or with patients with pneumonia of unknown cause', 'depending on where they live, their travel history or other exposures.

"Covid 19, We're about to exchange on a house but have been advised by the solicitor not to.

It says that while there is no need to pull out of transactions, buyers and renters should delay moving so they can observe social distancing and self-isolating guidelines.

If the house you are moving into is empty, it's fine to carry on as long as these rules are observed during the removals process. If the property is occupied, the government is encouraging the buyer and seller to find an alternative moving date further down the line.

Mortgage lenders have also been tightening their restrictions, with some requiring a deposit of at least 25%. But this doesn't affect mortgages which have already been agreed. Many lenders are offering customers who have already exchanged the option to extend their mortgage offer for up to three months so that they can move at a later date.

This timeframe may give you some idea of how long all of this could go on for, although nobody knows for sure.

The house buying process differs between Scotland and England and Wales, but the advice on delaying a move is the same.","We still don't know fully how Covid-19 affects pregnant women, but they have been placed into the ""high risk"" category meaning they should minimise all social contact.

The bill directs $350 billion for loans to small businesses and nonprofits with under 500 employees. The loans would be guaranteed by the Small Business Administration but the actual lender would be approved banks and financial institutions, which should get the money out the door faster. Businesses could receive up to $10 million in loans to float employee salaries, payroll expenses, mortgage and other debt payments.

 Dr. Robyn Gershon, a professor of epidemiology at New York University’s School of Public Health, has some tips: When you ride a bus or subway, sneeze or cough into your elbow. Use a tissue to hold onto a pole. Avoid touching your face while you’re riding, and use hand sanitizer if you have it while you’re commuting. 
 Again, wash your hands before, during and after your trip. 
 New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo recommends letting crowded trains or buses pass and waiting for a less crowded one. It’s nearly impossible to maintain 6 feet of distance on a packed subway car.

 Problems with public health infrastructure Two years ago, the CDC stopped funding epidemic prevention activities in 39 countries, including China. This happened because the Trump administration refused to allocate money to a program that started during the 2014 Ebola outbreak. 
 Former CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden warned that move “would significantly increase the chance an epidemic will spread without our knowledge and endanger lives in our country and around the world.”
 Problems with the testing Malfunctions, shortages and delays in availability have all contributed to the slowdown. 
 In the first few weeks of the outbreak in the US, the CDC was the only facility in the country that could confirm test results — even though a World Health Organization test became available around the same time. 
 Some test kits that were sent around the country were flawed — a move that put the US behind about “four to five weeks,” says Dr. Rob Davidson, executive director of the Committee to Protect Medicare.","[['Does the patient have recent travel from an affected area?\nHas the patient been in close contact with someone with COVID-19 or with patients with pneumonia of unknown cause', 'depending on where they live, their travel history or other exposures.

 Giving the sick person their own room to stay in, if possible. Keep the door closed.
 Having only one person serve as the caretaker.
 Asking the sick person to wear a face mask, if they are able to. If the mask causes breathing difficulties, then the caretaker should wear a mask instead.","The novel coronavirus is dangerous for several reasons, even if the number of deaths haven’t matched that of the flu.
 The first US case of coronavirus was reported in January, and the first US death from coronavirus was reported in late February. By April 9, the US had more than 456,800 cases of coronavirus, and more than 16,000 people have died.
 Since this flu season started October 1, more than 24,000 Americans have died from the flu, according to CDC estimates. Nationwide, the flu has infected at least 39 million people between October and late March. 
 But here are key differences when comparing the flu vs. coronavirus: 
 
 The CDC estimates for the flu go back to October 2019. But the first US case of coronavirus didn’t emerge until several months later.
 Coronavirus is twice as contagious as the flu. Research indicates a person with the flu infects an average of 1.28 other people, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said. But with coronavirus, “it’s likely between 2 and 3” other people.
 Coronavirus infections have a “very high mortality rate – one in six – among people who are over 80 and people with underlying chronic disease,” epidemiologist Dr. Abdul El-Sayed said. 
 People with coronavirus might not get symptoms for 14 days, and some get no symptoms at all. But during that time, they’re still contagious and can infect others unknowingly. 
 A vaccine is available for the flu, but no vaccine is available for coronavirus. Experts say the number of flu deaths could be drastically reduced if more people got their flu shots.

However, we don’t have direct data for this virus, nor do we have direct data for a temperature-based cutoff for inactivation at this point,” the CDC says. 
 “The necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface, the environment, etc.”
 President Donald Trump suggested this coronavirus could subside by the warmer summer months, but scientists say it’s too early to tell. And the fact that coronavirus keeps spreading in the Southern Hemisphere during its summer months suggests this strain might not succumb to warmer temperatures. 
 “The short answer is that while we may expect modest declines in the contagiousness of (novel coronavirus) in warmer, wetter weather and perhaps with the closing of schools … it is not reasonable to expect these declines alone to slow transmission enough to make a big dent,” wrote Dr. Marc Lipsitch, director of the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics at Harvard’s T.H.

"Covid 19, Should I wear a face mask in public? If so, how do I make one?","The CDC recently changed its guidance on wearing face masks as more studies about asymptomatic spread pile up.
 Now, the CDC “recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies).”
 But there are several important caveats and key points: 
 
 The public should NOT buy surgical masks or N95 respirator masks. Those are desperately needed by health care workers who are in close contact with coronavirus patients every day. 
 Instead, make your own cloth mask — it’s easy, and you don’t have to sew. US Surgeon General Jerome Adams shows how to make face masks with just a T-shirt and rubber bands in this CDC video. You can also use a bandana and a coffee filter. 
 Don’t be fooled: The main benefit of wearing masks in public isn’t to protect you from getting sick. Rather, it’s to protect others from yourself if you’re sick or you’re an asymptomatic carrier. “This is more for people who might be infected and don’t know it, and to try and lower the likelihood that they will spread this to somebody else,” CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said. The CDC agreed.
 You can definitely still get coronavirus even if you wear a mask. The virus can stay alive on surfaces for up to 3 days, and it’s easy to touch your face whenever you’re not wearing a mask. Also, people often adjust face masks frequently, leading to more touching of the face — a common way that coronavirus spreads.
 It’s important to wash your cloth mask after every use. Here’s how. 
 Wearing cloth masks is just “an additional, voluntary public health measure,” the CDC said. To protect yourself from getting coronavirus, it’s critical to stay 6 feet away from others, wash your hands frequently for at least 20 seconds each time, and stop touching your face.","States have received guidance from the CDC on how to keep voting locations clean. It’s up to you whether you feel comfortable going. 
 Many states that already held elections imposed measures to reduce contact between voters, increasing the distance between voting booths and rigorously disinfecting voting equipment. But if you go, remember – wash your hands before, during and afterward. 
 If you’re able to mail in your ballot, do – just don’t lick the envelope. 
 If you think you have a fever or respiratory symptoms, the CDC advises that you stay home. It’s unfortunate to skip out on your civic duty, but sick people shouldn’t visit crowded locations.","[['When walking on the road or waiting in the hospital, try to stay away from other people (at least 1 m away) and wear a mask', 'Disposable surgical mask (alternative strategy).

"Covid 19, Why worry about coronavirus when the flu kills many more people?","The novel coronavirus is dangerous for several reasons, even if the number of deaths haven’t matched that of the flu.
 The first US case of coronavirus was reported in January, and the first US death from coronavirus was reported in late February. By April 9, the US had more than 456,800 cases of coronavirus, and more than 16,000 people have died.
 Since this flu season started October 1, more than 24,000 Americans have died from the flu, according to CDC estimates. Nationwide, the flu has infected at least 39 million people between October and late March. 
 But here are key differences when comparing the flu vs. coronavirus: 
 
 The CDC estimates for the flu go back to October 2019. But the first US case of coronavirus didn’t emerge until several months later.
 Coronavirus is twice as contagious as the flu. Research indicates a person with the flu infects an average of 1.28 other people, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said. But with coronavirus, “it’s likely between 2 and 3” other people.
 Coronavirus infections have a “very high mortality rate – one in six – among people who are over 80 and people with underlying chronic disease,” epidemiologist Dr. Abdul El-Sayed said. 
 People with coronavirus might not get symptoms for 14 days, and some get no symptoms at all. But during that time, they’re still contagious and can infect others unknowingly. 
 A vaccine is available for the flu, but no vaccine is available for coronavirus. Experts say the number of flu deaths could be drastically reduced if more people got their flu shots. But about half of Americans don’t get vaccinated, including most children who die from the flu.","Anyone can get coronavirus.
 Any person who comes into close contact with someone who is infected is at risk for contracting the virus, according to the CDC.
 “Black people can get coronavirus, just like other people,” said Dr. Jennifer Caudle, an African-American family physician who has also been debunking coronavirus myths. 
 Caudle said she worries that some people may not take proper precautions to protect themselves against the virus because they may have heard this myth.
 In Africa, the pandemic is gaining a foothold. So far, the virus hasn’t spread in Africa as quickly as it has on some other continents. But numbers there are rising fast.","[['that 80% of deaths were among adults 65 years and older with the highest percentage of severe outcomes occurring in people 85 years and older', '2020', 'Does the patient have recent travel from an affected area?\nHas the patient been in close contact with someone with COVID-19 or with patients with pneumonia of unknown cause', 'family', 'disease']]","[[').

"Covid 19, Should I avoid public transportation?","If you rely on public transportation, use caution. If you’re sick or live in an area where an outbreak has been reported, avoid it. 
 Mass transit could increase your risk of exposure to coronavirus. Luckily, transit systems are upping their cleaning regimens — notably the New York subway system. 
 Dr. Robyn Gershon, a professor of epidemiology at New York University’s School of Public Health, has some tips: When you ride a bus or subway, sneeze or cough into your elbow. Use a tissue to hold onto a pole. Avoid touching your face while you’re riding, and use hand sanitizer if you have it while you’re commuting. 
 Again, wash your hands before, during and after your trip. 
 New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo recommends letting crowded trains or buses pass and waiting for a less crowded one. It’s nearly impossible to maintain 6 feet of distance on a packed subway car. 
 If you have a chronic illness, find alternative means of transportation — being in a crowded subway car or bus will significantly increase your risk of infection.","“Younger people, thankfully, seem to be insulated to some extent to protect (them) from getting particularly sick from this,” said CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta. “We don’t know entirely why.”
 But while children might have mild to no symptoms with coronavirus, they can still get others sick.
 “They can still carry the virus in their bodies,” Gupta said. “They could potentially still shed the virus and be a source of infection.”
 Like everyone else, children should wash their hands frequently for at least 20 seconds, stay at least 6 feet away from anyone coughing or sneezing, and stop touching their faces – which is a lot harder than it sounds.","[['avoid cruise travel and non-essential air travel.', 'depending on where they live, their travel history or other exposures', 'Does the patient have recent travel from an affected area?\nHas the patient been in close contact with someone with COVID-19 or with patients with pneumonia of unknown cause', 'People at higher risk of serious COVID-19 illness avoid cruise travel and non-essential air travel.', '.']]","[[', the misconceptions and the excessive panic of Chinese public to SARS led the public resistant to comply with the suggested preventive measures such as avoiding public transportation, going to hospital when they were sick', 'avoiding public transportation, going to hospital when they were sick', 'with underlying medical conditions and the elderly', 'People at higher risk of serious COVID-19 illness avoid cruise travel and non-essential air travel.', 'patients with underlying medical conditions and the elderly']]","[['Individuals should limit use of public transportation to when absolutely necessary and should limit potential exposure by spacing out at least six feet from other riders', 'Everybody should stay at home except for essential journeys.', 'all public transportation stopped operating in Bishkek, with exception of trolleybuses', ""Finland's Ministry for Foreign Affairs advised citizens to avoid unnecessary travel to Hubei province"", '52']]","[['19', ':', 'Public transportation', 'Public Transportation', 'Transportation']]","[['prohibits those who are symptomatic from using public transit as transport to their place of self-isolation, and prohibiting self-isolation in settings where they may come in contact with those who are vulnerable (people with pre-existing conditions and the elderly', 'it excluded buses and intercity passenger rail services', 'when people inhale droplets and small airborne particles (that form an aerosol) that infected people exhale as they breathe, talk, cough, sneeze, or sing', 's crit', 's.

"Covid 19, How long does coronavirus stay “alive” on surfaces?","Up to three days, depending on the surface. According to a study funded by the US National Institutes of Health:
 
 The novel coronavirus is viable up to 72 hours after being placed on stainless steel and plastic.
 It was viable up to four hours after being placed on copper, and up to 24 hours after being put on cardboard.
 In aerosols, it was viable for three hours.","The CDC recently changed its guidance on wearing face masks as more studies about asymptomatic spread pile up.
 Now, the CDC “recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies).”
 But there are several important caveats and key points: 
 
 The public should NOT buy surgical masks or N95 respirator masks. Those are desperately needed by health care workers who are in close contact with coronavirus patients every day. 
 Instead, make your own cloth mask — it’s easy, and you don’t have to sew. US Surgeon General Jerome Adams shows how to make face masks with just a T-shirt and rubber bands in this CDC video. You can also use a bandana and a coffee filter. 
 Don’t be fooled: The main benefit of wearing masks in public isn’t to protect you from getting sick. Rather, it’s to protect others from yourself if you’re sick or you’re an asymptomatic carrier. “This is more for people who might be infected and don’t know it, and to try and lower the likelihood that they will spread this to somebody else,” CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said. The CDC agreed.
 You can definitely still get coronavirus even if you wear a mask. The virus can stay alive on surfaces for up to 3 days, and it’s easy to touch your face whenever you’re not wearing a mask. Also, people often adjust face masks frequently, leading to more touching of the face — a common way that coronavirus spreads.
 It’s important to wash your cloth mask after every use. Here’s how. 
 Wearing cloth masks is just “an additional, voluntary public health measure,” the CDC said. To protect yourself from getting coronavirus, it’s critical to stay 6 feet away from others, wash your hands frequently for at least 20 seconds each time, and stop touching your face.","[['ten days', '14 days can enter the United States, but they are subject to health monitoring and possible quarantine for up to 14 days', '14 days', '14 days', '2020']]","[['2 months', 'g for long periods i', '10 days', '17 days', 'one month']]","[['12 weeks', 'week', '2 weeks', 'Extreme fatigue\n Long lasting cough\n Muscle weakness\n Low grade fever\n Inability to concentrate (brain fog)\n Memory lapses\n Changes in mood, sometimes accompanied by depression and other mental health problems\n Sleep difficulties\n Headaches\n Joint pain\n Needle pains in arms and legs\n Diarrhoea and bouts of vomiting\n Loss of taste and smell\n Sore throat and difficulties swallowing\n New onset of diabetes and hypertension\n Heartburn (gastroesophageal reflux disease)\n Skin rash\n Shortness of breath', '2019']]","[['2019', '2020', '2019', '2020', 'CDC site for COVID-19']]",[[]],[[]]

"Covid 19, What can I do if my loved one suspects they have coronavirus?","Don’t visit family members with suspected illness – keep up with them virtually.
 If that loved one lives with you, limit contact with them and avoid using the same bathroom or bedroom, the CDC advises.
 If they’ve been diagnosed, they may be able to recover at home in isolation. Separate yourself as much as possible from your infected family member and keep animals away, too. Continue to use separate restrooms and regularly disinfect them with EPA-approved products.
 Stock up on groceries and household supplies for them while they can’t travel outside and minimize trips to stores. Wash your hands frequently and avoid sharing personal items with the infected person.
 If you suspect you’re developing symptoms, stay home and call your physician.","Some cases of coronavirus do lead to pneumonia. But the pneumonia vaccine won’t help.
 “Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, only help protect people from these specific bacterial infections,” according to Harvard Medical School.
 “They do not protect against any coronavirus pneumonia.”
 The flu shot does not protect against coronavirus. But it does help protect against a massive, unnecessary burden on hospitals already overwhelmed with coronavirus.

"Covid 19, Can coronavirus go through skin and into the body?","“It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads,” the CDC says. 
 More often than not, people get coronavirus through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.

 Some have resorted to using plastic report covers as masks. The CDC said medical providers might have to use expired masks or reuse them between multiple patients. (This shortage is why the general public should not buy medical masks and instead make cloth masks at home.)
 But it’s not just subpar protective gear that puts medical workers at risk. It’s also the amount of virus they’re exposed to.

"Covid 19, Since a plane's cabin keeps circulating air, will I get sick if another passenger is sick?","Most viruses don’t spread easily on airplanes because of how the air circulates and is filtered, the CDC says. 
 Modern commercial jets recirculate 10-50% of the air in the cabin, mixed with outside air. 
 “The recirculated air passes through a series of filters 20-30 times per hour,” the CDC says. 
 “Furthermore, air generally circulates in defined areas within the aircraft, thus limiting the radius of distribution of pathogens spread by small-particle aerosols. As a result, the cabin air environment is not conducive to the spread of most infectious diseases.”
 Still, try to avoid contact with anyone sneezing or coughing.

 “At this point in time, there is no evidence that domestic animals, including pets and livestock, can spread COVID-19 to people.”
 That statement came after the Bronx Zoo said a tiger was infected by a zoo employee who was “asymptomatically infected with the virus.” The zoo had been closed to the public since March 16.
 The AVMA said “out of an abundance of caution, and until more is known about this virus, you should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19.”

"Covid 19, Why doesn’t the US have enough medical supplies to handle this outbreak?","Top healthcare officials say the US does not have enough stockpiled medical equipment like masks, gowns and gloves to meet the anticipated need as this pandemic grows.
 There are several reasons hospitals are on track to face dire shortages, said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert and professor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. 
 “About 20 or 30 years ago, we decided that we would not over-hospitalize,” Schaffner said.
 Back then, hospitals often had empty hospital beds for new patients. But now, many hospitals are “absolutely full,” Schaffner said. “We have under-built hospital beds because they are very expensive.”
 Also, Americans have grown accustomed to “just-in-time” ordering. But that becomes a huge problem when international supply chains are disrupted by an outbreak. “We didn’t anticipate international turbulence influencing this,” Schaffner said.
 Now, some health care workers are making their own masks. They’ve also been told they can use bandanas or scarves as masks.","If you rely on public transportation, use caution. If you’re sick or live in an area where an outbreak has been reported, avoid it. 
 Mass transit could increase your risk of exposure to coronavirus. Luckily, transit systems are upping their cleaning regimens — notably the New York subway system. 
 Dr. Robyn Gershon, a professor of epidemiology at New York University’s School of Public Health, has some tips: When you ride a bus or subway, sneeze or cough into your elbow. Use a tissue to hold onto a pole. Avoid touching your face while you’re riding, and use hand sanitizer if you have it while you’re commuting. 
 Again, wash your hands before, during and after your trip. 
 New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo recommends letting crowded trains or buses pass and waiting for a less crowded one. It’s nearly impossible to maintain 6 feet of distance on a packed subway car. 
 If you have a chronic illness, find alternative means of transportation — being in a crowded subway car or bus will significantly increase your risk of infection.","[['Most people have mild illness and are able to recover at home without medical care.\nFor people who are ill with COVID-19, but are not sick enough to be hospitalized, please follow CDC guidance on how to reduce the risk of spreading your illness to others.

 We’ve reported many stories about young people getting severely sick with or dying from coronavirus. 
 Dimitri Mitchell, 18, admits he had a “false sense of security.” But he was later hospitalized with coronavirus and now wants everyone to take it seriously. 
 “I just want to make sure everybody knows that no matter what their age is, it can seriously affect them. And it can seriously mess them up, like it messed me up,” Mitchell said. 
 He started feeling sick on St. Patrick’s Day, with just a small cough. “I thought at first it was just a normal cold. And then it started progressively getting worse,” he said. 
 “Four days in, the really bad symptoms started coming along. I started having really bad outbreaks, like sweating, and my eyes were really watery. I was getting warmer and warmer, and I was super fatigued. … I would start experiencing the worst headaches I’ve ever felt in my life. They were absolutely horrible.”
 Eventually, the teen had to be hospitalized. His mother said she worried he might “fall asleep and never wake up.” 
 Mitchell is now recovering, but still has a cough almost a month later. 
 “I just hope everybody’s responsible, because it’s nothing to joke about,” he said. “It’s a real problem, and I want everybody to make sure they’re following social distancing guidelines and the group limits. And just listen to all the rules and precautions and stay up to date with the news and make sure they’re informed.”","If you work in a city or state that requires sick leave and you use it, you can‘t be terminated or disciplined.

 “When you eat any kind of food, whether it be hot or cold, that food is going to go straight down into your stomach, where there’s a high acidity, low-pH environment that will inactivate the virus,” she said.
 But it’s a good idea to disinfect the takeout containers, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said. Coronavirus is a respiratory virus, and it’s easy to touch your face without realizing it.
 If you don’t have disinfecting wipes, use your own plates or bowls to serve the food.

 But there are important differences between the book and reality. The original version of the book called the strain the “Gorki-400,” in reference to a Russian locality, before it was later changed to the “Wuhan-400.” In the book, the virus was man-made, while scientists believe the novel coronavirus started in animals and jumped to humans.

 “They do not protect against any coronavirus pneumonia.”
 The flu shot does not protect against coronavirus. But it does help protect against a massive, unnecessary burden on hospitals already overwhelmed with coronavirus.

 “Unexpired household bleach will be effective against coronaviruses when properly diluted” if you’re trying to kill coronavirus on a non-porous surface, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. 
 The CDC’s recipe calls for diluting 5 tablespoons (or ⅓ cup) of bleach per gallon of water, or 4 teaspoons of bleach per quart of water. 
 You can also make your own hand sanitizer. The Nebraska Medical Center – famous for its biocontainment unit and treatment of Ebola patients – offers this recipe:
 What you’ll need:
 
 2/3 cup 91% isopropyl alcohol (rubbing alcohol)
 1/3 cup aloe vera gel
 Mixing bowl
 Spoon or something for whisking
 Small container, such as a 3 oz. travel bottle
 Optional: essential oil to give your hand sanitizer a fragrance
 
 Directions:
In a mixing bowl, stir isopropyl alcohol and aloe vera gel together until well blended.
Add 8-10 drops of scented essential oil (optional, but nice). Stir to incorporate.
Pour the homemade hand sanitizer into an empty container and seal.
Write “hand sanitizer” on a piece of masking tape and attach to the bottle.","If you work in a city or state that requires sick leave and you use it, you can‘t be terminated or disciplined.

 “When you speak, sometimes you’ll spit a little bit,” she said. “You’ll rub your nose. You’ll touch your mouth. You’ll rub your eyes.

 But it’s not just subpar protective gear that puts medical workers at risk. It’s also the amount of virus they’re exposed to.

"Covid 19, Why is the US so far behind other countries with testing?","Experts say it’s due to cuts in federal funding for public health and problems with early testing. 
 Problems with public health infrastructure Two years ago, the CDC stopped funding epidemic prevention activities in 39 countries, including China. This happened because the Trump administration refused to allocate money to a program that started during the 2014 Ebola outbreak. 
 Former CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden warned that move “would significantly increase the chance an epidemic will spread without our knowledge and endanger lives in our country and around the world.”
 Problems with the testing Malfunctions, shortages and delays in availability have all contributed to the slowdown. 
 In the first few weeks of the outbreak in the US, the CDC was the only facility in the country that could confirm test results — even though a World Health Organization test became available around the same time. 
 Some test kits that were sent around the country were flawed — a move that put the US behind about “four to five weeks,” says Dr. Rob Davidson, executive director of the Committee to Protect Medicare.","If you can, you should stay home from work when you’re sick, whether or not you have coronavirus.

"Covid 19, Can you contract COVID-19 more than once?","There have been media reports in China, Japan, and South Korea about
individuals who had the virus and eventually tested negative for it and were
released, only to test positive for it again a short time later.

Scientists in those countries have speculated that testing errors could be to
blame, either for a false negative that said the patients were free of the
virus or for the positive result that signalled its reoccurrence.

Dr. Iris Gorfinkel, a family physician and medical researcher, said it’s
really too soon to know whether an individual can contract COVID-19 more than
once, and how quickly that can happen.

“We actually don’t know. We don’t know how long-lasting the immunity is to
it,” she told CTV’s Your Morning on March 16. “These viruses have the tendency
to morph and change.”

In fact, it’s still not even clear if people develop an immediate immunity to
COVID-19, as is typically the case with other virus strains, such as the flu.

“So just like any other virus, there’s the possibility that it could shift or
drift. Just minor changes could change it from a once mild infection to a more
severe infection,” she explained.","As physical distancing recommendations have evolved, it has become clear that

recommends that all Canadians avoid ""non-essential"" gatherings.

the last two months we’ve been saying ‘We’ve got to prepare for this. We’ve

Bogoch said people should “optimize” their health by getting vaccinated for
everything that they are eligible to be vaccinated for, such as influenza or
bacterial pneumonias.

“It’s totally possible to have what’s called a co-infection and we know people
who have multiple infections at the same time can have a worse outcome,” he

the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC). If symptoms are present, they can
easily be mistaken for a common cold or the flu because of their similarities.

According to the health agency, the main symptoms of COVID-19 are fever,
coughing, difficulty breathing, and pneumonia in both lungs. In severe cases,
the illness can even result in death.

The World Health Organization lists additional symptoms that have been
documented in some COVID-19 patients, including tiredness, aches and pains,
sore throat, diarrhea, nausea and runny nose.

Gorfinkel said clinicians can’t distinguish between the illnesses based on
symptoms alone. She said they can all present the same way, which is why the
patient’s travel history or history of exposure to the virus is so important
in determining whether someone might have COVID-19.

“We do not have the facilities or the tests to test absolutely everybody, so
that history of travel if you’re basically otherwise well, that’s a critical
part of it,” she explained.","While the SARS-CoV-2 virus can linger on surfaces from anywhere to a couple of

precautions with those and people can simply wash them with tap water before

According to PHAC data, people in their 20s were responsible for 12 per cent
of all confirmed COVID-19 cases in Canada as of March 30, and those aged 19 or
younger made up 4 per cent of the country's total caseload.

Dr. Isaac Bogoch said that everyone can be infected by the novel coronavirus
and there’s always a risk that some people will have a more severe infection.

However, he said older people and those with underlying medical conditions
still have a greater risk of a severe outcome than younger individuals.

“If we take a step back and look at the 30,000-foot view and look at who is
more likely to get a severe infection, it is overwhelmingly those over the age
of 60 and really, over the age of 80 years old,” he told CTV’s Your Morning on
March 20.

Bogoch said the most important metric to look at when studying data about
severe infections from this virus is death.

“If you get infected, you either live or you die, it sounds morbid, but I
think that’s an extremely important distinction to make and if we look at
death, it is overwhelmingly in those over 60 and disproportionately high in

"Covid 19, Should you avoid Advil and other anti-inflammatories?","France’s health minister set off a wave of confusion when he warned that the
use of ibuprofen could become an “aggravating factor” for infection in
COVID-19 cases; however, the World Health Organization says there are no
reports to support this claim.

In an official response, the WHO said it’s not recommending against the use of
the common painkiller.

“We are also consulting with physicians treating COVID-19 patients and are not
aware of reports of any negative effects of ibuprofen, beyond the usual known
side-effects that limit its use in certain populations,” the WHO said in an
update on March 18.

Bogoch agreed with the WHO, saying there is still not enough data on the
subject.

“The short answer is we’re not entirely sure if this is going to do anything
or not. It’s unlikely to have any effect whatsoever,” he told CTV’s Your

"Covid 19, If you have been in isolation because one person in your household is sick, do you have to continue to stay home for another two weeks if another person falls ill?","For people living in households with multiple residents, it may be difficult
to avoid infecting each other. Dr. Isaac Bogoch says that if someone becomes
sick with COVID-19, the best course of action is to call the local public
health authority.

“It’s extremely important to call the local public health hotline to discuss
the exact situation so they can give you very specific recommendations based
on your unique setting,” he told CTV’s Your Morning.

In general, though, it appears the answer to that question may be a 'yes.'
PHAC says that anyone who has been in contact with a suspected, probably or
confirmed case of COVID-19 should self-isolate for 14 days, starting at the
time of contact.

This approach was taken by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who entered self-
isolation with his family after Sophie Gregoire Trudeau tested positive for
the virus. Once his wife was given the all clear, the prime minister said he
would [remain in isolation](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/trudeau-

"Covid 19, Should seniors and children be separated if they live in the same home?","While children appear to be less affected by the virus, elderly people and
those with other medical issues are more at risk of suffering a severe outcome
from a COVID-19 infection. For families that have both seniors and young
children living under the same roof, Bogoch said they should take care to
separate them if anyone shows symptoms. However, he said that should be the
case for anyone who is living with others and exhibits any symptoms, such as
fever, coughing, and difficulty breathing.

“You just have to be very mindful if anyone has any symptoms whatsoever they
should be separated,” he said.","While there have been suggestions that a regular flu shot can help protect
individuals against COVID-19, Bogoch said that’s not true.

“They do not protect against this particular infection. They do not protect

However, Bogoch stressed that vaccinations such as the flu shot are still
extremely important for optimizing health.

"Covid 19, How can caregivers protect themselves while helping someone with COVID-19 at home?","For people who are caring for a person who has been diagnosed with COVID-19,
the Public Health Agency of Canada has a number of tips on how they can
protect themselves while they provide care.

According to PHAC, only one healthy person should provide care to the
individual with COVID-19, and that person should limit their contact with them
as much as possible. They should also not share personal items with them, such
as toothbrushes, towels, bed linen, utensils or electronic devices. The ill
person should have their own bathroom, if possible. If not, they should put
the toilet lid down every time before flushing.

Caregivers should wear a mask, disposable gloves, and eye protection when
they’re in close proximity to the patient and never reuse the mask or gloves.
They should also frequently wash their hands with soap and water, especially
after contact with the sick individual.

What’s more, caregivers should remain vigilant about monitoring themselves for
symptoms for 14 days.","As physical distancing recommendations have evolved, it has become clear that
authorities do not want anyone to get close to anyone from outside their
household unless absolutely necessary.

""Stay home"" has become the refrain from political and public health leaders
seeking to flatten the curve of COVID-19 infectiuons.

""Physical distancing is proven to be one of the most effective ways to reduce
the spread of illness during an outbreak,"" PHAC says on its website, which
recommends that all Canadians avoid ""non-essential"" gatherings.

Gorfinkel said people should aim to avoid all unnecessary contact with
individuals to prevent further spread in their communities.

hours to a few days, Dr. Isaac Bogoch said it’s not necessary to wipe down
groceries after buying them at the store.

“I think if people go to the grocery store, they get groceries, I think it’s
just fair to put them away,” he told CTV’s Your Morning.

As for fruits and vegetables, Bogoch said there is no need to take any extra
precautions with those and people can simply wash them with tap water before
eating them, as they normally should.

"Covid 19, How bad will things get in Canada?","COVID-19 has caused widespread destruction around the world, with even
developed nations including Italy, France and Spain reporting thousands of
deaths and completely overwhelmed health-care systems.

The situation was rapidly deteriorating into something similar in the U.S. by
March 31, with New York City's iconic Central Park [turning into a makeshift

Projecting the spread of the virus through Canada at this point is nearly
impossible because of several factors, including uncertainty over how many
Canadians have actually been infected, unknowns around whether Canadians are
following public health recommendations well enough to curb COVID-19's spread,
and the lag time between when an infection occurs and when it is reflected in
the data.

""We don't exactly know where we are on the epidemic curve, and we don't

use of ibuprofen could become an “aggravating factor” for infection in
COVID-19 cases; however, the World Health Organization says there are no

the common painkiller.

“We are also consulting with physicians treating COVID-19 patients and are not
aware of reports of any negative effects of ibuprofen, beyond the usual known
side-effects that limit its use in certain populations,” the WHO said in an
update on March 18.

subject.

"Covid 19, How to protect yourself from Covid-19","As Covid-19 is spread through droplets, it can reach us through the air. Therefore, maintain social distancing, which means remaining 6 feet away from others.  Ideally, you shouldn't touch any surface on which droplets may have landed. The best way to protect yourself from exposed surfaces is to wash your hands frequently with soap and water for a count of 20.

"Covid 19, What exactly does it mean to flatten the curve?","Flattening the curve refers to the rate at which people are getting infected. Without intervention, the number of individuals who contract Covid-19 rises exponentially, which means it doubles at a constant rate — in this case, every three days. At such a rate, the number of infected individuals will overwhelm our hospital system, because we simply don't have enough hospital beds and respirators to treat them all. The United States doesn't even have enough protective equipment at present to protect its own health care workers. 

Doing the math, if one person is infected with the virus on Jan 1, with the number of people infected people doubling every 3 days, then by March 31, over 1 billion people will have become infected. With the world population being around 7.8 billion, it would only take until April 9 for all of us to be infected.

The situation in Italy has shown us that, without enough equipment, hospitals will be compelled to turn away some of the most infirmed among us, resulting in increased fatalities.  

Staying home does not prevent you from contracting the virus down the line, but from contracting the virus and overwhelming the medical establishment now.

The CARES Act not only provides relief for small business owners through loans but also allows the self-employed, independent contractors and part-time workers to collect unemployment benefits.
That initially seemed like double dipping to me. But as a colleague in the Twitterverse pointed out, it could make sense if your unemployment is covering personal expenses while your EIDL and/or PPP is covering other operating expenses. For example, if you are a restaurant owner, you have to pay for a mortgage, paid leave and supply chain disruptions, while we all wait out stay-at-home orders. But you also have to buy groceries and pay your home utility bills. If you can only get a loan to cover business expenses, you may still need unemployment benefits to pay your personal expenses.
Keep in mind, the details for unemployment benefits — eligibility rules, benefit amounts, length of payments, etc. — vary from state to state. In Illinois, for instance, to maintain your eligibility for unemployment, you must be able to work, you have to be available to accept a job and you have to be looking for work. If the additional loan funds allow you to keep running your business, it may be hard to demonstrate that you’re out of work.

"Covid 19, Can I get these loans and unemployment?","This was the most commonly asked question. The CARES Act not only provides relief for small business owners through loans but also allows the self-employed, independent contractors and part-time workers to collect unemployment benefits.
That initially seemed like double dipping to me. But as a colleague in the Twitterverse pointed out, it could make sense if your unemployment is covering personal expenses while your EIDL and/or PPP is covering other operating expenses. For example, if you are a restaurant owner, you have to pay for a mortgage, paid leave and supply chain disruptions, while we all wait out stay-at-home orders. But you also have to buy groceries and pay your home utility bills. If you can only get a loan to cover business expenses, you may still need unemployment benefits to pay your personal expenses.
Keep in mind, the details for unemployment benefits — eligibility rules, benefit amounts, length of payments, etc. — vary from state to state. In Illinois, for instance, to maintain your eligibility for unemployment, you must be able to work, you have to be available to accept a job and you have to be looking for work. If the additional loan funds allow you to keep running your business, it may be hard to demonstrate that you’re out of work.

"Covid 19, Can I get an Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) and a Paycheck Protection Program Loan (PPP)?","Yes, you can get both loans, but the key is to use the money to cover different expenses. Section 1102(a)(2)(G), the section outlining the PPP loans, explains the borrower requirements. It says the borrower has to certify that “the eligible recipient has not received amounts under this subsection for the same purpose and duplicative amounts.”
As a reminder, EIDLs can be used to cover:

Paid sick leave to employees unable to work due to the direct effect of COVID-19. Maintain payroll Increased costs due to supply chain disruption Rent or mortgage payments Repaying obligations that cannot be met due to revenue loss

PPP loan funds can be used to cover:

Payroll costs Group health care benefits during periods of paid, sick, medical, or family leave, and insurance premiums. Interest on a mortgage obligation Rent, under lease agreements in force before February 15, 2020 Utilities, for which service began before February 15, 2020 Interest on any debt incurred before February 15, 2020

So, if you’re getting an EIDL to cover payroll expenses, you can’t get a PPP to cover payroll for the length of the forgiveness period (eight weeks from when the loan is due). You would have to use the EIDL for different operating expenses or payroll for a different period. This will also go for other state or local assistance.
That being said, you don’t have to have both. If you’ve already gotten an EIDL for payroll purposes but just want the PPP loan, you can refinance the loan into a PPP. Any amount that was given to you as a grant under the EIDL will reduce the amount forgiven under PPP.","Flattening the curve refers to the rate at which people are getting infected. Without intervention, the number of individuals who contract Covid-19 rises exponentially, which means it doubles at a constant rate — in this case, every three days. At such a rate, the number of infected individuals will overwhelm our hospital system, because we simply don't have enough hospital beds and respirators to treat them all. The United States doesn't even have enough protective equipment at present to protect its own health care workers. 

Doing the math, if one person is infected with the virus on Jan 1, with the number of people infected people doubling every 3 days, then by March 31, over 1 billion people will have become infected. With the world population being around 7.8 billion, it would only take until April 9 for all of us to be infected.

The situation in Italy has shown us that, without enough equipment, hospitals will be compelled to turn away some of the most infirmed among us, resulting in increased fatalities.

In its most recent guidance, the SBA clarified that while income of sole proprietors and independent contractors count as payroll, payments to independent contractors do not count: “independent contractors have the ability to apply for a PPP loan on their own so they do not count for purposes of a borrower’s PPP loan calculation.”
Payroll also includes payment of compensation to employees for:

"Covid 19, I applied for EIDLs before the CARES Act went into effect. Should I apply again?",Yes. The SBA has specifically stated business owners looking for the grant need to apply through the new application that went up on Monday.,"The online application for EIDLs has been open since Monday. You can find it here. The feedback I’ve received so far is that it takes less than 30 minutes. You’ll need a profit and loss from January 31, 2019 – January 31, 2020. You’ll also need to unfreeze your credit report if you’ve frozen it. The SBA determines initial loan size based on your credit score, not your ability to pay.
You apply for the PPP through your local bank. Yesterday, the SBA offered a specific timeline for different applications.

Starting April 3, 2020, small businesses and sole proprietorships can apply for and receive loans to cover their payroll and other certain expenses through existing SBA lenders. Starting April 10, 2020, independent contractors and self-employed individuals can apply for and receive loans to cover their payroll and other certain expenses through existing SBA lenders. Other regulated lenders will be available to make these loans as soon as they are approved and enrolled in the program.

Just because your date isn’t here yet, it doesn’t mean you can’t start preparing for the process. You can find SBA lenders here.

"Covid 19, What exactly does it mean to flatten the curve?","Flattening the curve refers to the rate at which people are getting infected. Without intervention, the number of individuals who contract Covid-19 rises exponentially, which means it doubles at a constant rate — in this case, every three days. At such a rate, the number of infected individuals will overwhelm our hospital system, because we simply don't have enough hospital beds and respirators to treat them all. The United States doesn't even have enough protective equipment at present to protect its own health care workers. 

Doing the math, if one person is infected with the virus on Jan 1, with the number of people infected people doubling every 3 days, then by March 31, over 1 billion people will have become infected. With the world population being around 7.8 billion, it would only take until April 9 for all of us to be infected.

The situation in Italy has shown us that, without enough equipment, hospitals will be compelled to turn away some of the most infirmed among us, resulting in increased fatalities.  

Staying home does not prevent you from contracting the virus down the line, but from contracting the virus and overwhelming the medical establishment now. Postponing exposure buys time for the scientific and medical community to develop effective treatments or a vaccine to minimize or protect against infection.","As Covid-19 is spread through droplets, it can reach us through the air.

"Covid 19, What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?","Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority.

However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news. 


 
You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:


 
Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands. 



Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease. 



Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick. 



Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19. 



Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. 


 
Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections. 


 
Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease. Why?

If you develop fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical advice promptly as this may be due to a respiratory infection or other serious condition. Call in advance and tell your provider of any recent travel or contact with travelers.
Why? Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility.

For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.

COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It’s important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go.","It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses. Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment).

"Covid 19, How Does COVID-19 Spread?","People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.

WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings.","The infection period for the virus will vary from person to person.

And the picture so far is similar to what was documented in China. Coronavirus hits oldest people - older people the hardest. The CDC analysis found that about half of the people who've ended up in intensive care are 65 and older; the highest percentage of deaths in the U.S. has been among those 85 and older. Now this is based on an analysis of about 500 patients admitted to the hospital in the U.S. - so not all of the cases. But here's something to be aware of - younger adults can be vulnerable too; about 20% of people hospitalized were in their 40s and 50s. And this may come as a surprise - about 20% were younger.

Ko says it helps to understand the differing levels of risk in different situations. Coming into close contact with a person who is infected with coronavirus carries greater risk than touching a shopping cart that might have been touched by an infected person hours or days earlier.
When it comes to disinfecting things, it makes sense to focus on high-touch surfaces. Ko says you should worry more about disinfecting bathroom doorknobs and faucets at home than about a can of tomato soup from the supermarket.

"Covid 19, People are also asking about re-infection, whether you are immune to this once you've had it.","Well, with a lot of viruses, I mean, after you've gotten exposed to it the first time, you'll have partial protection against it going forward.

But for now, they're saying patients who have recovered from an infection are not likely to be re-infected shortly afterwards.","It probably can — but you shouldn't be overly worried. Here's why.
So far, there aren't scientific findings on how long the virus can live on fabric. But fabrics are generally porous — as is cardboard, which has been tested. And a recent study did find that the virus can live on cardboard for up to 24 hours.
""The thing that you have to consider, though, is that those tests are done in ideal testing circumstances,"" says Rachel Graham, a virologist at the University of North Carolina. ""That's like in some kind of hermetically sealed box where there's no fluctuation in humidity, there's no wind, there's nothing that can contribute toward desiccating the virus. And so desiccation — or drying out the virus — would actually reduce the amount of time it's actually viable on any kind of surface.""
Plus, porousness is a good thing when it comes to avoiding viral transmission. A surface that is permeable, like a fabric, tends to trap viruses more easily than hard surfaces.
""It's less at risk of transmitting because the virus gets kind of stuck to the [porous] surface, and so it can't be easily transferred back off of it,"" Graham says. ""Porous surfaces also suck the fluid out of it. The viral membrane is a lipid membrane, and so if that becomes dried out, it's basically done, infectivity-wise.""
If you are concerned that clothing or other fabric items might have picked up the virus, throw the clothing in the washer and dryer. For most situations, says Graham, your detergent will do its job and get rid of any infective particles — or at least sanitize them to the point where they're not a risk to you.
If you're taking care of someone who is ill or immunocompromised or if you're working in a health care setting, you may want to take additional precautions. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommendations for households with suspected or confirmed cases of the coronavirus, which include wearing gloves when handling dirty laundry from an ill person and using the warmest appropriate water setting when washing clothes or linens to disinfect them.
I like to use wipes to disinfect surfaces in my home — especially surfaces that are frequently touched. But how much surface area can one wipe be used on before it loses its ability to kill the coronavirus?
The first step is to check the label on the wipes you're using. For instance, the label on a container of Clorox wipes instructs: ""Use enough wipes for treated surface to remain visibly wet for 4 minutes. To kill viruses, let stand 15 seconds.""
That time and that visible wetness are important, says Erica Hartmann, an expert in environmental microbiology at Northwestern University's McCormick School of Engineering.
Regardless of the particular ingredients in the wipes you're using, ""they're all chemicals that have to react,"" she says. ""And those chemical reactions aren't instantaneous — they take a certain amount of time. So what you're doing when you're keeping the surface wet is you're basically allowing time, allowing the chemical reactions to take place.""
So if that Clorox wipe isn't making the surface visibly wet for 4 minutes, you're trying to cover too much ground with one wipe.
There's no exact figure for how much surface area a wipe can handle. But a 2018 study found that one wipe is generally more effective over 1 to 2 square feet than 8 square feet.
And you don't need a premade wipe to clean surfaces: You can also use a liquid product on a cloth or paper towel. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises using products that contain bleach (sodium hypochlorite) or alcohol (at least 70%) and following the manufacturer's directions. You can make your own cleaning solution by mixing 4 teaspoons of bleach per quart of water, according to the CDC.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has posted a list of approved products to disinfect against the coronavirus.
Strangers keep petting my dog when we go for a walk. Could my dog transmit the virus on its fur?
Saskia Popescu, an infection prevention epidemiologist at the health care system HonorHealth, says she's not especially concerned about dog fur transmitting the virus. ""I think that I would probably be more worried if somebody was coughing all over the place and went to touch my dog's harness or something — something inanimate,"" she says. ""I would put it in the lower-risk category.""
That's because like fabric, fur is a porous surface — so it isn't easy for a person to pick up bits of virus from it. ""The chances of you getting it from fur and hair is going to be less than getting it from a solid surface,"" says Graham, the virologist. Still, she said, she would err on the side of caution and ask people not to pet your dog right now.
Graham says one way to make sure your dog doesn't get touched by overenthusiastic petters is to avoid letting your dog off leash in a place where it may encounter other people. Rather than going to a dog park, she says, ""it might be a better idea to take your dog out in the yard or somewhere you know that there's not going to be a lot of people.""
And despite the occasional media report of a dog diagnosed with COVID-19, there is no evidence that pets can contract or spread COVID-19. The CDC says it has not received any reports of pets or animals becoming sick with the disease. The American Veterinary Medical Association concurs: ""Infectious disease experts and multiple international and domestic human and animal health organizations agree there is no evidence at this point to indicate that pets become ill with COVID-19 or that they spread it to other animals, including people.""

"Covid 19, So when might things begin to get back to normal?","Oh, gosh. Well, you know, we're halfway through that 15-day period announced last week asking everyone to hunker down, stay home. And what Anthony Fauci, the top adviser, has said over the weekend is that the social distancing, all the measures we're taking - they will have an effect. But we just can't quantify the effect yet. I mean, how much we may be slowing the spread here is masked by the significant increase in cases each day, as you just mentioned at the top.

So you know, as testing expands, we're going to get this increase in cases. Hard to see the progress here - it's likely going to be much, much longer before life feels like normal again, right? I mean, many schools have extended closures. There'll be lots of distance learning going on. Many scientists and public health experts watching China as the country lifts its restrictions. Does the virus stay under control, or does it start to spread again? We can learn a lot by watching what happens there.","Last week, the U.K. government signaled that it might be considering a different approach to coronavirus control than the rest of the world — in essence, allowing a large percentage of the population to become infected in order to develop a ""herd immunity"" that would eventually end the epidemic.
Herd immunity occurs when enough people in a population are immune to disease — either because they've been infected and recovered or they've been vaccinated against it. The idea is that the pool of people who can catch the disease has been reduced, reducing the risk to the so-far unaffected.
Sir Patrick Vallance, the U.K. government's chief scientific adviser, said that about 60% of the population would need to get the coronavirus in order to get a herd immunity effect.
But using such an approach would raise a big question: During that spread, how do you protect the most vulnerable groups – the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions?
Herd immunity works with contagious diseases like measles, for which a vaccine exists. But the idea that the U.K. would not immediately work to suppress the number of cases, especially as there are no approved treatments for COVID-19 yet and the disease has killed thousands in Italy, stirred an immediate public backlash.
The government quickly backtracked, and on Friday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said all restaurants, pubs and gyms would close for the foreseeable future to reduce transmission.
And there is no certainty that herd immunity would even work for coronavirus. That approach ""assumes that people being infected are immune and cannot get re-infected. And we don't know that as of yet,"" says Albert Ko, professor of epidemiology and medicine at the Yale School of Public Health.
People who go outside to exercise are sometimes shamed on TV and on social media for risky behavior. Is it okay to go outside for a walk, run or bike ride?
The White House coronavirus guidelines for the 15-day period that started Monday advise avoiding ""discretionary travel, shopping trips and social visits,"" as well as ""social gatherings in groups of more than 10 people."" But outdoor exercise is not on the list.
So unless local guidelines instruct otherwise, fresh air and outdoor exercise are allowed – though it's important to keep some distance between yourself and others. The coronavirus is thought to spread primarily through close contact between people – within about six feet.
The primary mode of transmission is through respiratory droplets.
There is better airflow outside than in confined spaces. That air flow outside reduces the risk of one person transmitting the virus to another through droplets in the air, says Albert Ko, the Yale epidemiologist. ""So if you're going out and you're hiking or biking or running and you're not within, say, six feet or 10 feet of another person, I would consider that a healthy, safe practice.""
Ko also points to the significant mental health issues that can be caused or exacerbated when people are cooped up.
""My personal feeling is that if people are practicing sound respiratory hygiene, sound hand hygiene, they're distancing themselves physically from others outside, and you're exercising and walking in the park — I think that's actually a good public health practice.""","[['Does the patient have recent travel from an affected area?\nHas the patient been in close contact with someone with COVID-19 or with patients with pneumonia of unknown cause', 'depending on where they live, their travel history or other exposures.

It's not yet clear whether people can be reinfected by this coronavirus or how long immunity might last after infection.
Immunity after recovery from COVID-19 would be a boon in the global fight to rein in the virus. People who have recovered and gained immunity would be especially valuable as health care workers. The spread of the virus would slow if more people had immunity to it. And antibodies from recovered people could help in developing a treatment for the disease.
As NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce has reported, scientists are looking for clues about immunity to and reinfection from other coronaviruses.
The severe coronaviruses SARS and MERS did produce antibodies in those who had the virus. In the case of MERS, survivors generated an immune response to the virus that could be detected up to two years later. And the sicker the patient was, the more long lasting their immune response.
But in the case of the four seasonal coronaviruses that are a cause of the common cold, they can sicken people over and over again. After infection with one of these viruses, antibodies are produced — but then the levels slowly decline and people become susceptible again.
There are some indications that the new coronavirus, officially known as SARS-CoV-2, can spur immunity. New not-yet-peer-reviewed research in rhesus macaques found that the new coronavirus does not cause reinfections.
""I think there's a very likely scenario where the virus comes through this year, and everyone gets some level of immunity to it, and if it comes back again, we will be protected from it,"" Matt Frieman, a coronavirus researcher at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore, told NPR.

"Covid 19, Can you get COVID-19 more than once?","The short answer: We don't know yet. It's not yet clear whether people can be reinfected by this coronavirus or how long immunity might last after infection.
Immunity after recovery from COVID-19 would be a boon in the global fight to rein in the virus. People who have recovered and gained immunity would be especially valuable as health care workers. The spread of the virus would slow if more people had immunity to it. And antibodies from recovered people could help in developing a treatment for the disease.
As NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce has reported, scientists are looking for clues about immunity to and reinfection from other coronaviruses.
The severe coronaviruses SARS and MERS did produce antibodies in those who had the virus. In the case of MERS, survivors generated an immune response to the virus that could be detected up to two years later. And the sicker the patient was, the more long lasting their immune response.
But in the case of the four seasonal coronaviruses that are a cause of the common cold, they can sicken people over and over again. After infection with one of these viruses, antibodies are produced — but then the levels slowly decline and people become susceptible again.
There are some indications that the new coronavirus, officially known as SARS-CoV-2, can spur immunity. New not-yet-peer-reviewed research in rhesus macaques found that the new coronavirus does not cause reinfections.
""I think there's a very likely scenario where the virus comes through this year, and everyone gets some level of immunity to it, and if it comes back again, we will be protected from it,"" Matt Frieman, a coronavirus researcher at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore, told NPR. ""Either completely or if you do get reinfected later, a year from now, then you have much less disease.""
""That is the hope,"" he adds. ""But there is no way to know that.""","So there is some overlap. But there are key differences, too. I've spoken to a bunch of allergists about this. And here is one very important distinction - fever is a symptom of COVID-19, but it is not a symptom of seasonal allergies. With all of that pollen starting to develop around the country, a lot of people are sneezing and will have a runny nose. These are typical symptoms of seasonal allergies but not necessarily typical of coronavirus. Cough is another very important distinction. Coughing is usually not a main symptom of seasonal allergies, but it is a key symptom of COVID-19, especially a dry cough.","[['depending on where they live, their travel history or other exposures.

"Covid 19, I heard that the U.K. was talking about using a ""herd immunity"" approach to the coronavirus. What exactly is herd immunity, and could it work against coronavirus?","Last week, the U.K. government signaled that it might be considering a different approach to coronavirus control than the rest of the world — in essence, allowing a large percentage of the population to become infected in order to develop a ""herd immunity"" that would eventually end the epidemic.
Herd immunity occurs when enough people in a population are immune to disease — either because they've been infected and recovered or they've been vaccinated against it. The idea is that the pool of people who can catch the disease has been reduced, reducing the risk to the so-far unaffected.
Sir Patrick Vallance, the U.K. government's chief scientific adviser, said that about 60% of the population would need to get the coronavirus in order to get a herd immunity effect.
But using such an approach would raise a big question: During that spread, how do you protect the most vulnerable groups – the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions?
Herd immunity works with contagious diseases like measles, for which a vaccine exists. But the idea that the U.K. would not immediately work to suppress the number of cases, especially as there are no approved treatments for COVID-19 yet and the disease has killed thousands in Italy, stirred an immediate public backlash.
The government quickly backtracked, and on Friday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said all restaurants, pubs and gyms would close for the foreseeable future to reduce transmission.
And there is no certainty that herd immunity would even work for coronavirus. That approach ""assumes that people being infected are immune and cannot get re-infected. And we don't know that as of yet,"" says Albert Ko, professor of epidemiology and medicine at the Yale School of Public Health.
People who go outside to exercise are sometimes shamed on TV and on social media for risky behavior. Is it okay to go outside for a walk, run or bike ride?
The White House coronavirus guidelines for the 15-day period that started Monday advise avoiding ""discretionary travel, shopping trips and social visits,"" as well as ""social gatherings in groups of more than 10 people."" But outdoor exercise is not on the list.
So unless local guidelines instruct otherwise, fresh air and outdoor exercise are allowed – though it's important to keep some distance between yourself and others. The coronavirus is thought to spread primarily through close contact between people – within about six feet.
The primary mode of transmission is through respiratory droplets.
There is better airflow outside than in confined spaces. That air flow outside reduces the risk of one person transmitting the virus to another through droplets in the air, says Albert Ko, the Yale epidemiologist. ""So if you're going out and you're hiking or biking or running and you're not within, say, six feet or 10 feet of another person, I would consider that a healthy, safe practice.""
Ko also points to the significant mental health issues that can be caused or exacerbated when people are cooped up.
""My personal feeling is that if people are practicing sound respiratory hygiene, sound hand hygiene, they're distancing themselves physically from others outside, and you're exercising and walking in the park — I think that's actually a good public health practice.""","There is little data so far on cloth or homemade masks in general — let alone data that dictates how many pleats to put on your home-sewn version.
Griffin says the best material to use is a tight-weave cotton. ""Don't use a synthetic or a polyester because they've looked at the virus's ability to survive on surfaces, and spandex is the worst,"" he says.
Johns Hopkins Medicine has one design you might try. Kaiser Permanente has another design, as well as a video showing how to make a mask using a sewing machine. Both recommend 100% woven cotton fabric. Kaiser recommends washing and drying the fabric two or three times before cutting it, so it doesn't shrink later.
You can make a mask out of a T-shirt, no sewing machine required. You could also try making one out of (unused) shop towels. But no matter what you make it out of, try to make it fit closely to your face and don't touch the front of it once you've started wearing it.","[['Does the patient have recent travel from an affected area?\nHas the patient been in close contact with someone with COVID-19 or with patients with pneumonia of unknown cause', 'include partial\nherd immunity limiting Virus spread in all but the most\nfavorable circumstances, which include lower environ-\nmental temperatures and human nasal temperatures (bene-\nﬁcial to thermolabile Viruses such as inﬂuenza), optimal\nhumidity, increased crowding indoors, and imperfect ven-\ntilation due to closed windows and suboptimal airﬂ', 'limited.

"Covid 19, I've heard that taking drugs like ibuprofen to ease COVID-19 symptoms could actually worsen the progress of the illness. Is that true?","The World Health Organization and many infectious disease experts say that there is no good scientific evidence establishing a link between ibuprofen and worsening of COVID‑19.
The notion that such a link exists was sparked last weekend when a tweet by the French health minister warned people not to take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs — a category of pain relievers and fever reducers that includes ibuprofen — because, he said, some French COVID-19 patients had experienced serious side effects. The warning was also included in a bulletin from the French health ministry, which counseled that patients should instead use acetaminophen, the generic name for Tylenol.
But experts say that warning isn't based on data.
""Based on currently available information, WHO does not recommend against the use of ibuprofen,"" the WHO stated on its official Twitter account, adding, ""'We are also consulting with physicians treating COVID-19 patients and are not aware of reports of any negative effects of ibuprofen, beyond the usual known side effects that limit its use in certain populations.""
Dr. Angela Rogers, a pulmonologist at the Stanford University Medical Center and chair of its intensive care unit's COVID-19 task force, notes that Tylenol is the go-to medication for patients who are sick enough to be hospitalized for any infection. That's because these patients are at higher risk of damage to internal organs, including kidneys. And kidney damage can be a side effect of ibuprofen for some patients who use it long-term in higher doses, says Rogers, whose research focuses on the kind of acute respiratory distress experienced by the most severe COVID-19 cases.
Tylenol, like any medicine, isn't risk-free either; Rogers notes that acetaminophen can cause serious liver damage in high doses. In low doses, though, she says, Tylenol is ""very effective"" for reducing fever and ""very safe.""","That's right. Well, the Milken Institute is tracking the development of a whole bunch of potential treatments and vaccines. They've identified literally dozens of different candidates in the works on both the vaccine side, the treatment side - over 40 different compounds being looked at for the vaccine. But a vaccine is definitely a ways off. I mean, 12 to 18 months is an optimistic estimate out there.

In regard to treatments, there are clinical trials underway to look at the safety, efficacy of different drugs, from antivirals to antibody treatments.

"Covid 19, How do I manage any risks while grocery shopping?","With new research that suggests the new coronavirus can live on surfaces for hours or days, the prospect of going grocery shopping can seem daunting.
But you can manage the risk.
First of all, the viability of the virus goes down over time and it's sensitive to temperature – so it dies off more quickly in room temperature than it does in the cold.
Second, when you go to a grocery store, people aren't generally touching all the cans on the shelf — although there tends to be more handling of individual items in the produce section.
Among the things you can do to protect yourself and others are:
Ko says it helps to understand the differing levels of risk in different situations. Coming into close contact with a person who is infected with coronavirus carries greater risk than touching a shopping cart that might have been touched by an infected person hours or days earlier.
When it comes to disinfecting things, it makes sense to focus on high-touch surfaces. Ko says you should worry more about disinfecting bathroom doorknobs and faucets at home than about a can of tomato soup from the supermarket.
""There's never anything that has zero risk,"" Ko says, ""but the risk is so much lower than [surfaces] that are more frequently touched.""","Yes. But only if you use the mask properly and don't touch it with your hands afterward.
Those droplets from a cough or sneeze would hit your mask instead of your mouth and nose — good news. But the next step is to take the mask off by the ear bands and either wash or discard it — without touching the front of it.
""That's what I see all the time,"" says Griffin. ""That's why in the studies, masks fail — people don't use them [correctly]. They touch the front of it. They adjust it. They push it down somehow to get their nose stuck out.""
If you touch the front of the mask, whatever that person coughed or sneezed on it is now on your hands.
As this video from the World Health Organization shows, you should take off your mask by removing the elastics or straps from behind your ears. Don't touch the front, and keep the mask away from your face.
One other thing: Ideally you would have eye protection, too, to keep that stranger's sneeze from getting in.

"Covid 19, Can face coverings prevent the spread of the virus?","The primary benefit of covering your nose and mouth is that you protect others. While there is still much to be learned about the novel coronavirus, it appears that many people who are infected are shedding the virus – through coughs, sneezes and other respiratory droplets – for 48 hours before they start feeling sick. And others who have the virus – up to 25%, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Robert Redfield — may never feel symptoms but may still play a role in transmitting it.
That's why wearing a mask even if you don't feel sick can be a good idea.
If you cough or sneeze, the mask can catch those respiratory droplets so they don't land on other people or surfaces. ""So it's not going to protect you, but it is going to protect your neighbor,"" says Dr. Daniel Griffin at Columbia University, an expert on infectious diseases. ""If your neighbor is wearing a mask and the same thing happens, they're going to protect you. So masks worn properly have the potential to benefit people.""
The best masks are N95 respirators, but the general public is urged not to use them because they are fiercely needed by health care workers right now. If you have those, consider donating them immediately to a local hospital or find a drop-off here. Same goes for surgical masks — those thin blue models-- which offer less protection but are helpful and are also in short supply.","As NPR has previously reported, some research has shown that cotton T-shirt material and tea towels might help block respiratory droplets emitting from sick people — though it's not clear how much protection they provide.
Another study, of health care workers in Vietnam, found that use of cloth masks resulted in greater infection than either those wearing surgical masks or a control group, some of whom also wore surgical masks.
We don't yet know exactly how effective homemade masks are, but Griffin thinks they're a good idea — he has even taken to wearing one over his N95 respirator.","[['depending on where they live, their travel history or other exposures.

As this video from the World Health Organization shows, you should take off your mask by removing the elastics or straps from behind your ears. Don't touch the front, and keep the mask away from your face.
One other thing: Ideally you would have eye protection, too, to keep that stranger's sneeze from getting in. Glasses and sunglasses aren't perfect but can help.","Sure. Well, we do have a preliminary snapshot of cases in the U.S. from the CDC. And the picture so far is similar to what was documented in China.

Now this is based on an analysis of about 500 patients admitted to the hospital in the U.S. - so not all of the cases. But here's something to be aware of - younger adults can be vulnerable too; about 20% of people hospitalized were in their 40s and 50s. And this may come as a surprise - about 20% were younger.

"Covid 19, What about homemade masks?","As NPR has previously reported, some research has shown that cotton T-shirt material and tea towels might help block respiratory droplets emitting from sick people — though it's not clear how much protection they provide.
Another study, of health care workers in Vietnam, found that use of cloth masks resulted in greater infection than either those wearing surgical masks or a control group, some of whom also wore surgical masks.
We don't yet know exactly how effective homemade masks are, but Griffin thinks they're a good idea — he has even taken to wearing one over his N95 respirator.","Well, we know it's been a very bumpy start - right? - lots of stories of delays, backlogs, despite promises to expand quickly.

"Covid 19, How often do I need to wash it?","Griffin says to think of a mask as like underwear: It needs to be washed after each use.
""You don't take this dirty mask off, put it in your purse and then stick it back on your face,"" he says. ""It's something that once you put on, is potentially either touching your coughs, sneezes or the spray of your speech, or protecting you from the coughs, spray, speech of other people. And now it's dirty. It needs to basically be either discarded or washed.""
So if you're wearing a cloth mask, put it into the laundry basket immediately. If it's disposable, throw it away.
It's a big no-no to pull the mask down to eat a snack, then pull it back up: You've just gotten whatever dirty stuff is on the mask on your hands and into your mouth.","Last week, the U.K. government signaled that it might be considering a different approach to coronavirus control than the rest of the world — in essence, allowing a large percentage of the population to become infected in order to develop a ""herd immunity"" that would eventually end the epidemic.
Herd immunity occurs when enough people in a population are immune to disease — either because they've been infected and recovered or they've been vaccinated against it. The idea is that the pool of people who can catch the disease has been reduced, reducing the risk to the so-far unaffected.
Sir Patrick Vallance, the U.K. government's chief scientific adviser, said that about 60% of the population would need to get the coronavirus in order to get a herd immunity effect.
But using such an approach would raise a big question: During that spread, how do you protect the most vulnerable groups – the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions?
Herd immunity works with contagious diseases like measles, for which a vaccine exists. But the idea that the U.K. would not immediately work to suppress the number of cases, especially as there are no approved treatments for COVID-19 yet and the disease has killed thousands in Italy, stirred an immediate public backlash.
The government quickly backtracked, and on Friday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said all restaurants, pubs and gyms would close for the foreseeable future to reduce transmission.
And there is no certainty that herd immunity would even work for coronavirus. That approach ""assumes that people being infected are immune and cannot get re-infected. And we don't know that as of yet,"" says Albert Ko, professor of epidemiology and medicine at the Yale School of Public Health.
People who go outside to exercise are sometimes shamed on TV and on social media for risky behavior. Is it okay to go outside for a walk, run or bike ride?
The White House coronavirus guidelines for the 15-day period that started Monday advise avoiding ""discretionary travel, shopping trips and social visits,"" as well as ""social gatherings in groups of more than 10 people."" But outdoor exercise is not on the list.
So unless local guidelines instruct otherwise, fresh air and outdoor exercise are allowed – though it's important to keep some distance between yourself and others. The coronavirus is thought to spread primarily through close contact between people – within about six feet.
The primary mode of transmission is through respiratory droplets.
There is better airflow outside than in confined spaces. That air flow outside reduces the risk of one person transmitting the virus to another through droplets in the air, says Albert Ko, the Yale epidemiologist. ""So if you're going out and you're hiking or biking or running and you're not within, say, six feet or 10 feet of another person, I would consider that a healthy, safe practice.""
Ko also points to the significant mental health issues that can be caused or exacerbated when people are cooped up.
""My personal feeling is that if people are practicing sound respiratory hygiene, sound hand hygiene, they're distancing themselves physically from others outside, and you're exercising and walking in the park — I think that's actually a good public health practice.""","[['depending on where they live, their travel history or other exposures.

"Covid 19, Is there one best mask design?","There is little data so far on cloth or homemade masks in general — let alone data that dictates how many pleats to put on your home-sewn version.
Griffin says the best material to use is a tight-weave cotton. ""Don't use a synthetic or a polyester because they've looked at the virus's ability to survive on surfaces, and spandex is the worst,"" he says.
Johns Hopkins Medicine has one design you might try. Kaiser Permanente has another design, as well as a video showing how to make a mask using a sewing machine. Both recommend 100% woven cotton fabric. Kaiser recommends washing and drying the fabric two or three times before cutting it, so it doesn't shrink later.
You can make a mask out of a T-shirt, no sewing machine required. You could also try making one out of (unused) shop towels. But no matter what you make it out of, try to make it fit closely to your face and don't touch the front of it once you've started wearing it.","Oh, gosh.

So you know, as testing expands, we're going to get this increase in cases. Hard to see the progress here - it's likely going to be much, much longer before life feels like normal again, right?

"Covid 19, I’m having trouble paying my bills. What can I do?","__**Student loans** The Department of Education has granted a payment waiver of at least 60 days to many people. But it’s not necessarily automatic. In general, you have to call your loan servicer to request a waiver and to make sure that your loan is eligible.

With the stimulus package, there will be [automatic payment suspensions for any student loan](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-stimulus- package-questions-answers.html) held by the federal government until Sept. 30. It may be hard to contact many of the loan servicers right now, so check your account online in the coming weeks.  **Utility bills** Some utility providers are offering to stop cutting people off for nonpayment. A number of large internet companies have agreed not to terminate residential or small-business customers who can’t pay their bills. Exact policies and requirements vary, though, so if you need help, you should call and ask.  **Housing** There’s also a good chance you can delay your mortgage payment if the outbreak has left you short of money. The Federal Housing Finance Agency has instructed mortgage servicers to allow borrowers whose mortgages are owned by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac to delay payments.

That means sticking to a regular bedtime and wake time. Try to go 90 minutes without any screen time before bed -- that means no emails, social media or watching T.V. You can also take baby steps, beginning with 15 minutes, then working your way up.  Working out, whether that means taking a socially distant walk or doing an at- home routine, can also help tire you out and dispel extra nervous energy.

But in the long term, moderation is important. Your body’s physical stress response may affect what kinds of foods you are reaching for, drawing you more toward carbohydrates and foods that are high in fat. Take stock of how any stress and anxiety may have affected your eating habits.  If you think you’re snacking too much when you’re not hungry, it may help to allow some time to pass and distract yourself with another activity before grabbing more food. Try to add some healthy snacks like fruits and vegetables into your routine, if you can.  If you’re regularly not eating enough, find something you can tolerate eating, or drink a calorie-rich beverage, like a protein shake. If you’re forgetting to eat entirely, schedule your mealtimes into your calendar and treat meals like any other essential appointment.

When pumping gas, sanitize your hands after replacing the pump and before you touch the car door handle, steering wheel and any other part of the vehicle. If an attendant pumped the gas for you, sanitize your credit card after it is handed back to you.  Minimize bathroom breaks as much as possible. While this advice goes against AAA’s general advice to take a break every 100 miles, Mr. Sinclair said drivers could rest in vehicles at scenic overlooks or in parking lots of rest stops. Otherwise, wash your hands after using a public restroom and before touching your car.

"Covid 19, What are some of the details of the stimulus package?","The legislation would send direct payments of $1,200 to millions of Americans, including those earning up to $75,000, and an additional $500 per child. It expands jobless aid, providing an additional 13 weeks and a four-month enhancement of benefits, and extends the payments for the first time to freelancers and gig workers.  The measure would also offer $377 billion in federally guaranteed loans to small businesses and establish a $500 billion government lending program for distressed companies reeling from the impact of the crisis, including allowing the administration the ability to take equity stakes in airlines that received aid to help compensate taxpayers. It would also send $100 billion to hospitals on the front lines of the pandemic.","__**Student loans** The Department of Education has granted a payment waiver of at least 60 days to many people. But it’s not necessarily automatic. In general, you have to call your loan servicer to request a waiver and to make sure that your loan is eligible. The waiver does not apply to private student loans. One big private lender, Sallie Mae, said it is offering suspension of payment for up to three months, with no damage to a borrower’s credit.  With the stimulus package, there will be [automatic payment suspensions for any student loan](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-stimulus- package-questions-answers.html) held by the federal government until Sept. 30. It may be hard to contact many of the loan servicers right now, so check your account online in the coming weeks.  **Utility bills** Some utility providers are offering to stop cutting people off for nonpayment. A number of large internet companies have agreed not to terminate residential or small-business customers who can’t pay their bills. Exact policies and requirements vary, though, so if you need help, you should call and ask.  **Housing** There’s also a good chance you can delay your mortgage payment if the outbreak has left you short of money. The Federal Housing Finance Agency has instructed mortgage servicers to allow borrowers whose mortgages are owned by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac to delay payments. If you rent, the best national resource we’ve found so far is the search-by-state function on [Justshelter.org](https://justshelter.org/community-resources/). This offers information on local organizations that can provide advice to renters in distress.  **Loans and credit** Many consumer lenders are offering affected customers help if they can’t make payments. The American Bankers Association has a list of lenders here, although the help they’re offering varies.

"Covid 19, Why is every country responding so differently?","A lot has to do with politics and history.

That’s contributed to the lack of a united response. While the W.H.O. is supposed to coordinate the global response to epidemics, the group, a U.N. agency, doesn’t have the authority to force countries to follow its plan.

Some experts believe the virus may also be airborne, but the wider consensus is that it’s droplet-spread.

"Covid 19, Is there a cure?","There’s no treatment for coronavirus. Some hospitals in China and in Queensland have used antiviral drugs to treat sufferers, and there are clinical trials into the effectiveness of antiviral treatments. But the care of patients is largely what’s known as supportive care, or making the patient comfortable: for example, giving Panadol to lower fever or giving oxygen if someone is struggling to breathe. In critical cases, a person would be placed on a heart-lung life-support machine in an intensive care unit, but most people who contract the virus don’t need to go to hospital and can recover at home in isolation.","For most people, COVID-19 causes mild respiratory illness. Common symptoms are fever, shortness of breath and coughing. Some people also get a runny nose or muscle aches, although those are far less common. For some people, the disease can progress to pneumonia, and it usually gets worse in the second week. Estimates have varied, but the experience in China suggests the death rate may be about 1 per cent, although the WHO has put it slightly higher. But chances of dying depend significantly on age and state of health — the very young rarely seem to be affected at all, while the death rate in the elderly is much higher, about 15 per cent. People with comorbidities such as heart or lung conditions, or diabetes, have a higher risk of death.","[['but there is no treatment for this virus.

The University of Queensland has developed a vaccine candidate, and it’s being tested on animals at the moment.

But getting a vaccine to the market is a slow process, because health authorities have to be 100 per cent sure it’s safe.

If you hear a rumor about the virus, check it out with reputable sources — the CDC, state health agencies and the WHO all have websites with the most up-to-date information about the virus and its spread.
Increasingly, those agencies also have fact-checking sections on their websites, aimed at combating misinformation. One of the most troubling rumors that often spreads alongside outbreaks is who exactly has the disease — something that can lead to racial and ethnic profiling.
Nirav Shah, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said it is important to separate the disease from the person suffering from the disease. No ethnic group is more or less susceptible to the coronavirus.
“My concern is that fear and misinformation will spread much faster than this virus will,” Shah said in an interview Wednesday.

The virus probably jumped from an animal — we still don’t know for sure what species — to a human, a process of interspecies transmission called zoonosis.

But officials are increasingly worried about South Korea, where the number of cases has climbed from just a handful to more than 1,200 in the last week or so. An outbreak in Italy has infected 322 people, a worrying sign that the virus may be gaining a foothold in Europe. Seven other European nations confirmed new cases of the virus overnight. And an outbreak in Iran has infected more than 100 residents.
“The sudden increases in cases in Italy, the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Republic of Korea are deeply concerning,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Wednesday.
The Iranian outbreak has spawned new cases in Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait and Oman; the Italian outbreak is now linked to cases in Algeria, Austria, Croatia, Germany, Spain and Switzerland.
Tuesday marked a sobering moment for epidemiologists watching the virus: It was the first day that more new cases were confirmed in countries besides China than new cases in China itself, according to the WHO.
There have been 57 cases diagnosed in the United States, 36 of whom were repatriated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Most of the rest of the cases have occurred in travelers who have recently returned from China.

"Covid 19, How deadly is the virus?","We don’t entirely know yet. Of the 81,191 confirmed cases, 2,768 people have died, a mortality rate of about 3 percent. That would be worse than the Spanish Flu, which had a mortality rate of about 2 percent, and substantially worse than a more ordinary influenza, which kills between one in a thousand and one in ten thousand people.
But there are lots of unknowns.
First, the bad news: Only about 30,000 people have recovered from the virus, which leaves 50,000 or so still in some stage of treatment. Not all of those people will recover, so the mortality rate is expected to rise at least a little bit.
Now, the good news: That 81,191 figure represents only the number of confirmed cases. It appears likely that many thousands more were infected and either did not suffer symptoms or suffered symptoms too minor to seek treatment. In that case, the mortality rate is probably substantially lower than the statistics make it seem.","For a single tax filer, the rebate amount reduces by $5 for every $100 of income over $75,000.

Keep in mind that phase-out of the credit is based on people’s adjusted gross income, which does not include income put into pre-tax accounts such as traditional 401(k)s.

"Covid 19, How sick will the coronavirus make someone?","That depends on your underlying health. Coronaviruses are not uncommon — you’ve almost certainly had several during your lifetime, and at worst you might have called in sick with a common cold. And even if you contract this particular coronavirus, you may show few if any signs.
But if your health is poor already — especially your respiratory system — this virus is more troubling. Many of those who have succumbed have been older, and young children may be particularly susceptible as well. Those who become ill will have problems in their upper respiratory tract; those who become severely ill will have problems in the lower respiratory tract, and those can lead to really serious health concerns like pneumonia and bronchitis.","At the moment, the federal government is doing a lot of warning. The CDC has produced two dozen guidance documents for hospitals, instructions for preparedness and infection control. Crucially, they are offering guidance on preserving personal protection equipment — like masks and gloves — in a recognition that a widespread outbreak is likely to impact already-low supplies.
The Trump administration has created a task force to oversee the response, led by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. But the administration has not named a coordinator to oversee a whole-of-government response, similar to what the Obama administration did during the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa.
In other words, there is no one person whose full-time job is to oversee the government’s response.

His administration has requested $2.5 billion in emergency funding, but even Republicans have been skeptical that that’s enough to handle a widespread outbreak. Senate Democrats on Wednesday said they would seek $8.5 billion in funding.
On a state level, hospitals and public health officials are preparing for a growing number of cases. State health directors happen to be in Washington this week for an annual meeting, and many spent Wednesday walking the halls of Congress, lobbying their members to support funding.
At home, those officials are working to make sure their hospitals have the capacity they need to handle an outbreak — enough beds, enough equipment and protective gear, enough laboratory capacity to test samples they take from potentially infected victims, and enough people to run the tests.
“We’re starting to work with hospitals and EMS systems initially to make sure that they have all the capacity that they need,” Shah said of Maine’s preparations. “The public should appreciate that hospitals are used to taking care of sick people. That is what they do.”
What are the broader risks, beyond the virus?
We’ve already seen the virus’s impact in China, where factories and stores closed for days or weeks and cities have been quarantined to stop its spread. Other countries may follow China’s lead. Frieden said the outbreak is likely to cost at least $100 billion to combat globally — and maybe ten times as much, if things spiral out of control.
But as in other outbreaks, the fallout is going to extend beyond immediate health concerns. When Ebola broke out in West Africa, more people died from other, treatable diseases — malaria, cholera, even HIV — because the health systems shut down.
In this case, China is a major source of the generic drugs used in the United States, for everything from hypertension to diabetes. The virus is likely to impact supply chains, making scarce drugs that are completely unrelated to the coronavirus. Experts recommend keeping a three-month supply of any prescription drugs you take on hand in case of that disruption.
“The Chinese manufacturing issue will affect us,” says Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Preparedness at the University of Minnesota. “We’ll have a major shortfall between what will be needed and what will be available.”
Personal protective equipment, like masks and gloves, are already in short supply after a particularly bad flu season. Manufacturers are rushing to fill the gaps, but that takes time, and global demand is growing.
The Department of Health and Human Services said it has a stockpile of about 30 million masks, but says it needs 300 million to protect front-line health care workers. Those workers, who treat patients, would be most at risk of contracting the virus; more than 3,000 health care workers have been infected in China already.
The broader economic impact is also unknown, though Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, said in a note to investors Wednesday that the odds of a recession in the first half of the year now stand at 40 percent, twice what he predicted a few months ago.
“If it is a pandemic, if it does show up in Europe and the United States, then that is the prescription for a global and U.S. recession,” he said.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 are both off more than 6 percent in the last two days, the worst two-day drop in years.
There is a decent chance that major sporting events and public gatherings will be delayed or canceled. A major trade show, the Mobile World Congress, has already been canceled in Barcelona, Spain. Soccer games have been canceled in Italy, and political demonstrations are temporarily banned in Seoul, South Korea.
The organizers of the Tokyo Olympics, set for later this year, have insisted the games will go on. But a former top International Olympic Committee official, Dick Pound, cast doubt on those plans on Tuesday, saying the organizers had about a three-month window in which to decide to pull the plug.
The last time the Olympics were canceled was in 1944, when games scheduled for Italy and London were scrapped because of World War II.","[['depending on where they live, their travel history or other exposures.

The vast majority of those cases, 78,064, are in mainland China, and most of those are in Hubei Province, the epicenter of the outbreak.
But officials are increasingly worried about South Korea, where the number of cases has climbed from just a handful to more than 1,200 in the last week or so. An outbreak in Italy has infected 322 people, a worrying sign that the virus may be gaining a foothold in Europe. Seven other European nations confirmed new cases of the virus overnight. And an outbreak in Iran has infected more than 100 residents.
“The sudden increases in cases in Italy, the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Republic of Korea are deeply concerning,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Wednesday.
The Iranian outbreak has spawned new cases in Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait and Oman; the Italian outbreak is now linked to cases in Algeria, Austria, Croatia, Germany, Spain and Switzerland.
Tuesday marked a sobering moment for epidemiologists watching the virus: It was the first day that more new cases were confirmed in countries besides China than new cases in China itself, according to the WHO.
There have been 57 cases diagnosed in the United States, 36 of whom were repatriated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Most of the rest of the cases have occurred in travelers who have recently returned from China.

"Covid 19, How easy is it to catch the coronavirus?","Tom Frieden, who directed the CDC for eight years during the Obama administration, says it’s too early to know exactly how transmissible the virus is, how long it lives on surfaces or how many people who get the disease become really sick.
“There’s still a lot we don’t know about this infection. We don’t know how readily it spreads, we don’t know, really, what proportion of people get severely ill,” he told The Hill.
But what we do know is that the virus spreads from person to person through air droplets, much like an influenza. That makes it dissimilar from something more deadly, like Ebola, which spreads only when someone comes into contact with another person’s bodily fluids. There are signs, too, that the coronavirus can transmit even before someone shows symptoms, which is going to cause problems for health officials trying to contain its spread.
Now is a good opportunity to remind ourselves the lessons we teach toddlers: Wash your hands a lot. Cough or sneeze into your elbow. Stay at home if you’re sick. Those little steps end up having big, positive consequences.
Anyone who comes into contact with someone infected with the virus should notify their health care provider, the CDC says. Older people and young children, especially those with underlying health concerns, are at the most risk.","Coronaviruses are a relatively broad family of viruses named for the spikes that come out of a virus particle. Under a microscope, they look like a crown, or a halo — like the sun’s corona.
The current coronavirus first emerged from Wuhan, in China’s Hubei Province, most likely from a fish and animal market where humans routinely come into direct contact with animals. The virus probably jumped from an animal — we still don’t know for sure what species — to a human, a process of interspecies transmission called zoonosis.
The virus itself is called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2.

"Covid 19, What about a vaccine? Or treatments?","The coronavirus is a new phenomenon, which means scientists are only now beginning to research possible treatments or vaccines. No treatments have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, though there is a drug being tested on a patient who was repatriated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship.
That drug, Remdesivir, was first developed as a potential treatment for MERS and SARS in animals and for Ebola in humans. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is working on a study to test whether the drug would be a suitable treatment for this coronavirus.
But until a treatment is developed, someone with a severe case of the virus will be treated with supportive care — in extreme cases, with intubation tubes and breathing machines.
The real silver bullet for any epidemic or pandemic is a vaccine — and that’s going to take a while. Some in the Trump administration have promised a vaccine within the space of a few months, but that’s extremely unlikely. Instead, the top expert in the federal government, NIAID Director Anthony Fauci, has said he hopes to have a vaccine developed in the next 12 to 18 months, a relatively fast timeline by scientific standards.","If you received a refund in 2018 or 2019 via direct deposit to your bank account, and you did not change your bank account when you moved, you should be able to receive your rebate via direct deposit.

"Covid 19, Where should I get my information about the virus?","Public health officials are increasingly worried about misinformation that seems to accompany every outbreak, fueled by social media and inflammatory rhetoric.
If you hear a rumor about the virus, check it out with reputable sources — the CDC, state health agencies and the WHO all have websites with the most up-to-date information about the virus and its spread.
Increasingly, those agencies also have fact-checking sections on their websites, aimed at combating misinformation. One of the most troubling rumors that often spreads alongside outbreaks is who exactly has the disease — something that can lead to racial and ethnic profiling.
Nirav Shah, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said it is important to separate the disease from the person suffering from the disease. No ethnic group is more or less susceptible to the coronavirus.
“My concern is that fear and misinformation will spread much faster than this virus will,” Shah said in an interview Wednesday.
Bottom line: If you hear what sounds like unrealistic information, check it out before you pass it around social media.","The coronavirus relief bill is not yet law, and the IRS has yet to provide information about how it plans to implement the provision about the rebates.

"Covid 19, What is the U.S. government doing to combat the virus?","At the moment, the federal government is doing a lot of warning. The CDC has produced two dozen guidance documents for hospitals, instructions for preparedness and infection control. Crucially, they are offering guidance on preserving personal protection equipment — like masks and gloves — in a recognition that a widespread outbreak is likely to impact already-low supplies.
The Trump administration has created a task force to oversee the response, led by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. But the administration has not named a coordinator to oversee a whole-of-government response, similar to what the Obama administration did during the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa.
In other words, there is no one person whose full-time job is to oversee the government’s response.
President TrumpDonald John TrumpWaPo: Trump allegedly asked Fauci if officials could let coronavirus 'wash over' US Kansas Supreme Court upholds order banning religious services of over 10 people Biden wins Alaska primary MORE plans to hold a press conference on Wednesday at 6:30 p.m. ET alongside members of his coronavirus task force. His administration has requested $2.5 billion in emergency funding, but even Republicans have been skeptical that that’s enough to handle a widespread outbreak. Senate Democrats on Wednesday said they would seek $8.5 billion in funding.
On a state level, hospitals and public health officials are preparing for a growing number of cases. State health directors happen to be in Washington this week for an annual meeting, and many spent Wednesday walking the halls of Congress, lobbying their members to support funding.
At home, those officials are working to make sure their hospitals have the capacity they need to handle an outbreak — enough beds, enough equipment and protective gear, enough laboratory capacity to test samples they take from potentially infected victims, and enough people to run the tests.
“We’re starting to work with hospitals and EMS systems initially to make sure that they have all the capacity that they need,” Shah said of Maine’s preparations. “The public should appreciate that hospitals are used to taking care of sick people. That is what they do.”
What are the broader risks, beyond the virus?
We’ve already seen the virus’s impact in China, where factories and stores closed for days or weeks and cities have been quarantined to stop its spread. Other countries may follow China’s lead. Frieden said the outbreak is likely to cost at least $100 billion to combat globally — and maybe ten times as much, if things spiral out of control.
But as in other outbreaks, the fallout is going to extend beyond immediate health concerns. When Ebola broke out in West Africa, more people died from other, treatable diseases — malaria, cholera, even HIV — because the health systems shut down.
In this case, China is a major source of the generic drugs used in the United States, for everything from hypertension to diabetes. The virus is likely to impact supply chains, making scarce drugs that are completely unrelated to the coronavirus. Experts recommend keeping a three-month supply of any prescription drugs you take on hand in case of that disruption.
“The Chinese manufacturing issue will affect us,” says Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Preparedness at the University of Minnesota. “We’ll have a major shortfall between what will be needed and what will be available.”
Personal protective equipment, like masks and gloves, are already in short supply after a particularly bad flu season. Manufacturers are rushing to fill the gaps, but that takes time, and global demand is growing.
The Department of Health and Human Services said it has a stockpile of about 30 million masks, but says it needs 300 million to protect front-line health care workers. Those workers, who treat patients, would be most at risk of contracting the virus; more than 3,000 health care workers have been infected in China already.
The broader economic impact is also unknown, though Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, said in a note to investors Wednesday that the odds of a recession in the first half of the year now stand at 40 percent, twice what he predicted a few months ago.
“If it is a pandemic, if it does show up in Europe and the United States, then that is the prescription for a global and U.S. recession,” he said.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 are both off more than 6 percent in the last two days, the worst two-day drop in years.
There is a decent chance that major sporting events and public gatherings will be delayed or canceled. A major trade show, the Mobile World Congress, has already been canceled in Barcelona, Spain. Soccer games have been canceled in Italy, and political demonstrations are temporarily banned in Seoul, South Korea.
The organizers of the Tokyo Olympics, set for later this year, have insisted the games will go on. But a former top International Olympic Committee official, Dick Pound, cast doubt on those plans on Tuesday, saying the organizers had about a three-month window in which to decide to pull the plug.
The last time the Olympics were canceled was in 1944, when games scheduled for Italy and London were scrapped because of World War II.","If you received a refund in 2018 or 2019 via direct deposit to your bank account, and you did not change your bank account when you moved, you should be able to receive your rebate via direct deposit.

"Covid 19, Can people get checks even if they haven’t filed a tax return in recent years?","In cases where people haven’t filed tax returns but receive Social Security benefits or railroad retirement benefits, the IRS can look at statements about those benefits to help get the checks to those people.

For people who have not filed a 2018 or 2019 tax return and do not receive Social Security or railroad retirement benefits, there is an incentive to promptly file a tax return to ensure that the IRS can reach them to distribute the money to them this year. 

People who do not file tax returns are typically low-income. For example, the IRS requires married couples with both spouses under 65 to file returns for 2019 if their gross income was at least $24,400. That threshold is raised to $27,000 in cases where both spouses were 65 or older. Social Security benefits often aren’t included in gross income.","The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported at least 81,191 cases of the virus as of Wednesday morning. The vast majority of those cases, 78,064, are in mainland China, and most of those are in Hubei Province, the epicenter of the outbreak.
But officials are increasingly worried about South Korea, where the number of cases has climbed from just a handful to more than 1,200 in the last week or so. An outbreak in Italy has infected 322 people, a worrying sign that the virus may be gaining a foothold in Europe. Seven other European nations confirmed new cases of the virus overnight. And an outbreak in Iran has infected more than 100 residents.
“The sudden increases in cases in Italy, the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Republic of Korea are deeply concerning,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Wednesday.
The Iranian outbreak has spawned new cases in Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait and Oman; the Italian outbreak is now linked to cases in Algeria, Austria, Croatia, Germany, Spain and Switzerland.
Tuesday marked a sobering moment for epidemiologists watching the virus: It was the first day that more new cases were confirmed in countries besides China than new cases in China itself, according to the WHO.
There have been 57 cases diagnosed in the United States, 36 of whom were repatriated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Most of the rest of the cases have occurred in travelers who have recently returned from China. Just two people have been infected in the United States itself.","[['U.S. citizens, residents, and their immediate family members who have been any one of those countries within in the past 14 days can enter the United States, but they are subject to health monitoring and possible quarantine for up to 14 days', 'depending on where they live, their travel history or other exposures.

"Covid 19, Can humans become infected with the COVID-19 from an animal source?","Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in animals. Occasionally, people get infected with these viruses which may then spread to other people. For example, SARS-CoV was associated with civet cats and MERS-CoV is transmitted by dromedary camels. Possible animal sources of COVID-19 have not yet been confirmed. To protect yourself, such as when visiting live animal markets, avoid direct contact with animals and surfaces in contact with animals. Ensure good food safety practices at all times. Handle raw meat, milk or animal organs with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods and avoid consuming raw or undercooked animal products.","What does it feel like?

"Covid 19, How does COVID-19 spread?","People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.","Can a person cured of Covid-19, get infected again? This is a viral infection. Like swine flu or H1N1, if you are exposed to it, you can get infected again. But once you get the infection, the human system develops antibodies to fight the virus which is why in case you contract the infection again it is likely to be less severe than before. So, if after getting cured for Covid-19, you end up getting infected again, you might have milder symptoms.","[['More than half of the U.S. is seeing some level of community spread of COVID-19', 'depending on where they live, their travel history or other exposures.

"Covid 19, What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?","You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:

 1: Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.

 2: Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.

 3: Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.

 4: Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.

 5: Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.

 6: Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places - especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease. Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.","Can I go out in my vehicle to pick up someone who is stranded somewhere?

"Covid 19, How to put on, use, take off and dispose of a mask?","1: Remember, a mask should only be used by health workers, care takers, and individuals with respiratory symptoms, such as fever and cough.

2: Before touching the mask, clean hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water

3: Take the mask and inspect it for tears or holes.

4: Orient which side is the top side (where the metal strip is).

5: Ensure the proper side of the mask faces outwards (the coloured side).

6: Place the mask to your face. Pinch the metal strip or stiff edge of the mask so it moulds to the shape of your nose.

7: Pull down the mask's bottom so it covers your mouth and your chin.

8: After use, take off the mask; remove the elastic loops from behind the ears while keeping the mask away from your face and clothes, to avoid touching potentially contaminated surfaces of the mask.

9: Discard the mask in a closed bin immediately after use.

10: Perform hand hygiene after touching or discarding the mask - Use alcohol-based hand rub or, if visibly soiled, wash your hands with soap and water.","How deadly is it?

"Covid 19, For how long will the lockdown continue?","For how long will the lockdown continue?
A majority of the states have issued guidelines until March 31, however, there are some instances where advisories have been issued for shut down of services till mid-April.","You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:

 1: Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.

 2: Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.

 3: Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.

 4: Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.

 5: Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.

 6: Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places - especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease. Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.","[['ten days', '14 days', '14 days', 'banning of any non-essential public gatherings, closure of educational', 'Does the patient have recent travel from an affected area?\nHas the patient been in close contact with someone with COVID-19 or with patients with pneumonia of unknown cause']]","[['ten days', 'week number 6 in 2020', 'one month', '14 days', 'al distan']]","[['21 days', 'three-week', '29 May', '24 May.', ""more than a third of the world's population""]]","[['24 May', '24 March', 'with a longer lockdown forecast to cause greater damage', 'more than 280\xa0million people, or about 86% of the population', '19']]","[['three weeks', 'two weeks', 'three months', 'four weeks', '234 days']]","[['21 days', '21 days', 'two weeks', 'two weeks', 'four month']]"

"Covid 19, How it spreads","How it spreads
Most spread is from droplets produced when an infected person coughs, which are inhaled by people nearby. Transmission from touching contaminated surfaces hasn't been shown yet, though recent tests by US scientists suggest it's possible -- one reason they recommend washing your hands and not touching your face. The virus can live in the air for several hours, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. Cleaning surfaces with solutions containing diluted bleach should kill it. ""While we are still learning about the biology of this virus, it does not appear that there is a major risk of spread through sweat,"" said Julie Fischer, a Georgetown University microbiologist. The biggest concern about going to the gym is infected people coughing on others, or contaminating shared surfaces or equipment, she said. Consider avoiding large classes and peak hours and don't go if you're coughing or feverish, she suggests. The risk of virus transmission from food servers is the same risk as transmission from other infected people, but ""one of the concerns in that food servers, like others facing stark choices about insurance and paychecks, may be pressured to work even if they are sick,"" she said.","Will petrol pumps work?

"Covid 19, Can infected people who recover get it again?","Can infected people who recover get it again?
It's not known. A few reports from China say some people had COVID-19, recovered and then fell ill again. It's unclear if that's a relapse, a new infection, or a case where the person never fully recovered in the first place. Scientists at the at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle say the 30,000-letter genetic code of the virus changes by one letter every 15 days. It's not known how many of these changes would be needed for the virus to seem different enough to the immune system of someone who had a previous version of it for it to cause a fresh infection. Fauci told Congress on Thursday that it was unlikely that someone could get reinfected. ""We haven't formally proved it, but it is strongly likely that that's the case,"" he said. ""Because if this acts like any other virus, once you recover, you won't get reinfected.""","It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses. Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment).

The average time from exposure to developing symptoms is five to six days, but can be up to two weeks. Tests have found high amounts of virus in the throats and noses of people a couple days before they show symptoms. Signs of virus also have been found in stool weeks after patients recover, but that doesn't mean it's capable of causing illness, scientists warn. ""The virus can be degraded,"" said Robert Webster, a St. Jude Children's Research Center virus expert. ""It's not necessarily infectious virus at all.""","Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019. However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms.

Doctors initially diagnosed the man with the flu and later diagnosed the coronavirus.

Doctors studying the patient said the case ""suggests that COVID-19 might be underdiagnosed because of false-negative tests for upper respiratory specimens or co-infection with other respiratory viruses. Broader viral testing might be needed.""

Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, agrees.

"Covid 19, Can testing show if someone has had coronavirus and then recovered?","Yes, but it depends on what kind of test you do. ""If you do an antibody test, in theory it could show that you had the virus and then recovered,"" Hotez said.

To do an antibody test, you'd need to have blood drawn. But coronavirus tests in the U.S. aren't being done this way.","Depending on the type of surface, the virus can stay on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days, according to the WHO. A recent study by scientists in the U.S. found that viable virus could be detected up to three hours later in the air, up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. 

However, a subsequent report from the CDC found that genetic material from the virus can live on surfaces for more than two weeks. The CDC found traces of the virus' RNA, not the coronavirus itself, on surfaces in the cabins of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship – 17 days after passengers had left the cabins.

It's possible that you can become infected if you touch your face after touching a surface or object that has the virus on it, according to the CDC. But scientists don't think surfaces are the main way that the virus spreads; the most common form of infection is from respiratory droplets spread by a person's cough or sneeze, the CDC reports.

Meanwhile, the WHO says it is very unlikely that the virus will persist on a surface after being moved, traveled and exposed to different conditions and temperatures. That means the virus cannot spread through goods manufactured in China or any country reporting coronavirus cases.

At the same time, the WHO is reportedly encouraging people to use as many digital payment options as possible. Viruses can survive on hard surfaces like coins for days in some cases.

"Covid 19, How long does the virus live on an object like a dollar bill?","Depending on the type of surface, the virus can stay on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days, according to the WHO. A recent study by scientists in the U.S. found that viable virus could be detected up to three hours later in the air, up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. 

However, a subsequent report from the CDC found that genetic material from the virus can live on surfaces for more than two weeks. The CDC found traces of the virus' RNA, not the coronavirus itself, on surfaces in the cabins of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship – 17 days after passengers had left the cabins.

It's possible that you can become infected if you touch your face after touching a surface or object that has the virus on it, according to the CDC. But scientists don't think surfaces are the main way that the virus spreads; the most common form of infection is from respiratory droplets spread by a person's cough or sneeze, the CDC reports.

Meanwhile, the WHO says it is very unlikely that the virus will persist on a surface after being moved, traveled and exposed to different conditions and temperatures. That means the virus cannot spread through goods manufactured in China or any country reporting coronavirus cases.

At the same time, the WHO is reportedly encouraging people to use as many digital payment options as possible. Viruses can survive on hard surfaces like coins for days in some cases.

A recent study by scientists in the U.S. found that viable virus could be detected up to three hours later in the air, up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. 

However, a subsequent report from the CDC found that genetic material from the virus can live on surfaces for more than two weeks. The CDC found traces of the virus' RNA, not the coronavirus itself, on surfaces in the cabins of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship – 17 days after passengers had left the cabins.

It's possible that you can become infected if you touch your face after touching a surface or object that has the virus on it, according to the CDC. But scientists don't think surfaces are the main way that the virus spreads; the most common form of infection is from respiratory droplets spread by a person's cough or sneeze, the CDC reports.

Meanwhile, the WHO says it is very unlikely that the virus will persist on a surface after being moved, traveled and exposed to different conditions and temperatures. That means the virus cannot spread through goods manufactured in China or any country reporting coronavirus cases.

"Covid 19, What is involved in testing for the coronavirus? Is it the same as when they do a nasal swab for influenza?","To collect a sample for a diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the COVID-19 disease, doctors typically use the same method of collection as they would for influenza: a nasopharyngeal swab. For this swab, a tiny Q-tip on plastic or a wire stem is put up your nose about 3 or 4 inches.

""I've had it done, and it's mildly uncomfortable for a few seconds,"" said Gregory Poland, director of the Mayo Clinic’s Vaccine Research Group.

A doctor may also do a throat swab. In some cases, if you have a ""wet"" cough, a doctor may also have you cough up some phlegm into a collection cup. These specimen are then packed with ice and shipped to a lab for testing.

To determine if someone has recovered from the coronavirus, at least two different nasal swabs taken at least 24 hours apart must test negative, Poland said.","A study of more than 72,000 cases in mainland China found that at least one person between ten and 19 years of age had died, but no one younger than ten had died. A subsequent study in the journal Pediatrics found that a 14-year-old boy from China died in February after contracting the coronavirus.

"Covid 19, How long does the virus live on an object like a dollar bill?","Depending on the type of surface, the virus can stay on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days, according to the WHO. A recent study by scientists in the U.S. found that viable virus could be detected up to three hours later in the air, up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. 

However, a subsequent report from the CDC found that genetic material from the virus can live on surfaces for more than two weeks. The CDC found traces of the virus' RNA, not the coronavirus itself, on surfaces in the cabins of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship – 17 days after passengers had left the cabins.

It's possible that you can become infected if you touch your face after touching a surface or object that has the virus on it, according to the CDC. But scientists don't think surfaces are the main way that the virus spreads; the most common form of infection is from respiratory droplets spread by a person's cough or sneeze, the CDC reports.

Meanwhile, the WHO says it is very unlikely that the virus will persist on a surface after being moved, traveled and exposed to different conditions and temperatures. That means the virus cannot spread through goods manufactured in China or any country reporting coronavirus cases.

At the same time, the WHO is reportedly encouraging people to use as many digital payment options as possible. Viruses can survive on hard surfaces like coins for days in some cases.

"Covid 19, What are dangers to pregnant women?
","It's unclear how the coronavirus may affect pregnant women. In general, pregnant women may experience changes to their body that could make them more susceptible to viral respiratory infections, according to the CDC.

In the case of SARS and MERS, pregnant women were more at risk for severe illness, and some experienced miscarriage and stillbirth, according to the CDC.

There is no evidence that the virus can be transmitted from an infected mother to her fetus, and, in a limited number of recent cases of infants born to mothers with COVID-19, none of the infants have tested positive for the virus, the CDC said.","There is no vaccine for the new virus and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-19, so treatment consists of supportive care to help relieve symptoms and, for severe cases, care to support vital organ functions, the CDC says.
